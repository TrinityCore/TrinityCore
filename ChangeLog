 * Updated default data for player creation. Actions, items, skills and spells moved to database.

 ==== Server Features ====
 * Added support for building with Intel C++ compiler on Windows.
 * Added support for building with debug info on Linux. Use --with-debug-info switch to include debug info.
 * Added support for building with 1.8.x protocol as default protocol. Use the 1.8.x build configurations in Visual Studio or --enable-18x switch on Linux.
 * Added support for building with 1.7.x protocol. Use the 1.7.x build configurations in Visual Studio or --enable-17x switch on Linux.
 * Added support for internal httpd server added for those not running Apache. --enable-httpd-integrated will add it. Windows solution available.
 * Added support for displaying progress bars for daemon startup loading.
 * Added support for on demand Grid Loading/Unloading system, which is disabled by default.
 * Added core application framework.
 * Added support for console commands (setgm,ban,create,info)
 * Added command line switch -c for pointing to a custom configuration file. By default file from _MANGOSD_CONFIG (defined in src/mangosd/Master.h.in) will be used.
 * Fixed ZThread build process.
 * Fixed segmentation fault on zone map test due to access of array out of bound. Also, change m_ZoneIDmap to use bitset instead of the 4 bytes bool.
 * Fixed memory leak problems. The creation of new TYPE[] must delete with [] for correctness otherwise n-1 members are leaked.

 ==== Statistics ====
 * Fixed Bugs: #4, #7, #12, #13, #16, #18, #19

MaNGOS 0.0.1  (Sept 13, 2005) http://www.mangosproject.org/trac/milestone/0.0.1

 MaNGOS 0.0.1 - Codename "Endeavour" - contains a great number of new features,
 improvements and bug fixes. The following list contains all of them:

 * NPC gossips now hash by Guid instead of ID. ID is meaningless and we should revisit its usage.
 * Fixed client crash issue. GameObject still not interactive. Flags issues.
 * Introduced new gameobjecttemplate table as well new map files.
 * Added SCP-to-SQL converter to contrib/scp-to-sql/.
 * MySQL 4.0 branch now is minimum requirement.
 * Server causes client to core on unintialized memory. Also, remove some debug statement which causes problem when the DB is large
 * Creature loot now reads from the creatureloot table. Use a new algorithm to select loot items that mimic the probabilities assigned in each item.
 * Fixed configuration file, added proper settings for packet logging.
 * Added default data for player creation and command help.
 * Added GM command: .addspw #entry-id. Spawns a creature from creaturetemplate table by given #entry-id.
 * Server randomly cores if DBC file failed to load. Fixes by intializing all DBC class internal variables.
 * Daemon version and path to daemon configuration now set by build system on compile time.
 * Allow connections from client release 4544
 * Update solution and project files for latest Visual Studio .NET 2005 Beta 2 release.
 * Fixed compiler error for gcc 4.0 or higher. Calling templated base class methods has to be explicit from 4.0 or higher on.
 * Added contrib/ subdirectory for third-party tools.
 * Applied MaNGOS code indention schema.
 * Initial code checked into repository.

 ==== Statistics ====
