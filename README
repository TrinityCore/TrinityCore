== Welcome to MaNGOS ==

MaNGOS (the Massive Network Game Object Server) is an Open Source reference
implementation for a MMORPG server system. Please see the file COPYING for
license details.

For further information on the MaNGOS project, please visit our project web
site at <http://www.mangosproject.org/>

Documenation on various development related topics can be found in the doc/
subdirectory, including Doxygen-generated API documentation.

The required SQL files for creating the database backend are included in the
sql/ subdirectory. In case you are upgrading from an older MaNGOS release,
make sure you as well take a look at the SQL files in the sql/updates/ sub-
directory.

In order to build and install MaNGOS under Linux, follow the instructions
described in the INSTALL file.

In case you have checked out MaNGOS from the SubVersion repository, please run

$ autoreconf --install --force

prior to building, as you may otherwise not be able to run a build.
