TrinityCore is a MMORPG Framework based mostly on C++. It is completely 
open source, and is community supported. It is derived
from MaNGOS, the Massive Network Game Object Server, and is based on the
code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize, improve
and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the ingame mechanics
and functionality. If you wish to contribute ideas or code please visit 
our site linked below or make pull requests to our github repo at 
https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore

Documentation including installation instructions can be found inside
the doc directory.

SQL files to create the databases can be found in the sql/create and 
sql/base directories.
You need to run sql/create/create_mysql.sql 1st and then
sql/base/auth_database.sql and sql/base/characters_database.sql
You need to download world database from http://www.trinitycore.org/f/files/
be sure you get the higher numbered database.
When installing a core the 1st time you need to import also the files at
sql/updates/world directory.
sql/updates/auth and sql/updates/characters databases only needs to be run
when updating one existing server.
To save time importing multiple files, you can use copy *.sql world_updates.sql
under Windows or cat *.sql > world_updates under Linux.

You need to update your core (recompile and overwrite binaries) when updating
your database, usually you can't use one older core with a newer database or a
newer core with a older database.
When updating your core you also need to import the files at sql/updates/auth
and sql/updates/characters along with sql/updates/world files.
You can't merge all the sql files on sql/updates into a single file, because
they belong to 3 different databases and they don't use database name.
