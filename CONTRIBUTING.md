# Contributing

Want to contribute? Great!

1. Fork it.
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b fixes`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am "Added Snarkdown"`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin fixes`)
5. Open a [Pull Request][1]


When creating patches read:
- [TrinityCore Development Standards](http://www.trinitycore.org/f/topic/6-trinitycore-developing-standards/)
- [WDB Fields](http://www.trinitycore.org/f/topic/58-wdb-fields/)
- [Git Squash](https://ariejan.net/2011/07/05/git-squash-your-latests-commits-into-one/)

We suggest you to create one branch for each `C++` based fix: on that way you can continue creating more fixes without having to wait to get one pull request merged.  
For the `SQL` files of `C++` based fixes the naming schema is: `YYYY_MM_DD_i_database_description.sql`, where `YYYY_MM_DD` is the date of the fix, `i_database` is the *ith* sql created that day for `database`. 
When doing changes to `auth` or `characters` database remember to update the base files (`/sql/base/*`).  
For SQL only fixes [create a ticket](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/issues/new).
