# Objscale [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rochet2/TrinityCore.svg?branch=objscale_master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rochet2/TrinityCore)

#### About
Objscale allows scaling individual spawns of creatures and gameobjects.
You can do this change ingame with commands or in the `creature` and `gameobject` database tables.

- Diff in github view: https://github.com/Rochet2/TrinityCore/compare/TrinityCore:master...objscale_master

Using direct merge:
- open git bash to source location
- do `git remote add rochet2 https://github.com/Rochet2/TrinityCore.git`
- do `git pull rochet2 objscale_master`
- use cmake and compile

Using diff:
- DO NOT COPY THE DIFF DIRECTLY! It causes apply to fail.
- download the diff by __right clicking__ the link and select __Save link as__
- place the downloaded `objscale.diff` to the source root folder
- open git bash to source location
- do `git apply objscale.diff`
- use cmake and compile

After compiling:
- Run files named `*_objscale.sql` from `src\server\scripts\Custom\objscale\sql` to your databases.

#### Usage
You can set the sizes in the `creature` and `gameobject` database tables in the world database by changing the `size` column.
In game you can change a spawned object's size by using `.gobject set scale #guid #scale` and spawned NPC sizes by selecting an NPC and using `.npc set scale #scale`
Using -1 has scale makes the gameobject and npc use the default scale from template.

Known issues:
- You can not resize some gameobject types. This is likely a client limitation.
- You may need to relog to see the size changes for some wow patches or versions of the core.
