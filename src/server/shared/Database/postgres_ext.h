 *
 *	   This file contains declarations of things that are visible everywhere
 *	in PostgreSQL *and* are visible to clients of frontend interface libraries.
 *	For example, the Oid type is part of the API of libpq and other libraries.
 *
 *	   Declarations which are specific to a particular interface should
 *	go in the header file for that interface (such as libpq-fe.h).	This
 *	file is only for fundamental Postgres declarations.
 *
 *	   User-written C functions don't count as "external to Postgres."
 *	Those function much as local modifications to the backend itself, and
 *	use header files that are otherwise internal to Postgres to interface
 *	with the backend.
