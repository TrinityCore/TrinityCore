/**
 * WorldSocket.
 *
 * This class is responsible for the communication with
 * remote clients.
 * Most methods return -1 on failure.
 * The class uses reference counting.
 *
 * For output the class uses one buffer (64K usually) and
 * a queue where it stores packet if there is no place on
 * the queue. The reason this is done, is because the server
 * does really a lot of small-size writes to it, and it doesn't
 * scale well to allocate memory for every. When something is
 * written to the output buffer the socket is not immediately
 * activated for output (again for the same reason), there
 * is 10ms celling (thats why there is Update() method).
 * This concept is similar to TCP_CORK, but TCP_CORK
 * uses 200ms celling. As result overhead generated by
 * sending packets from "producer" threads is minimal,
 * and doing a lot of writes with small size is tolerated.
 *
 * The calls to Update() method are managed by WorldSocketMgr
 * and ReactorRunnable.
 *
 * For input, the class uses one 4096 bytes buffer on stack
 * to which it does recv() calls. And then received data is
 * distributed where its needed. 4096 matches pretty well the
 * traffic generated by client for now.
 *
 * The input/output do speculative reads/writes (AKA it tryes
 * to read all data available in the kernel buffer or tryes to
 * write everything available in userspace buffer),
 * which is ok for using with Level and Edge Triggered IO
 * notification.
