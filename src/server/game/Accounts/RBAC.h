/**
* @file RBAC.h
* @brief Role Based Access Control related classes definition
*
* This file contains all the classes and enums used to implement
* Role Based Access Control
*
* RBAC Rules:
* - Pemission: Defines an autorization to perform certain operation.
* - Role: Set of permissions.
* - Group: Set of roles.
* - An Account can have multiple groups, roles and permissions.
* - Account Groups can only be granted or revoked
* - Account Roles and Permissions can be granted, denied or revoked
* - Grant: Assignment of the object (role/permission) and allow it
* - Deny: Assignment of the object (role/permission) and deny it
* - Revoke: Removal of the object (role/permission) no matter if it was granted or denied
* - Global Permissions are computed as:
*       Group Grants + Role Grants + User Grans - Role Grants - User Grants
* - Groups, Roles and Permissions can be assigned by realm
