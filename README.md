## Introduction

KitronCore is a *MMORPG* Framework based mostly in C++.

It is derived from *MaNGOS*, the *Massive Network Game Object Server*, and is
based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to optimize,
improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game
mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.

If you wish to contribute ideas or code, please visit our site linked below or
make pull requests to our [Github repository](https://github.com/KitronCore/KitronCore/pulls).

For further information on the KitronCore project, please visit our project
website at [KitronCore.org](https://www.Kitroncore.org).

## Reporting issues

Issues can be reported via the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/KitronCore/KitronCore/labels/Branch-3.3.5a).
