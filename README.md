# NozdormuCore

## Introduction

NozdormuCore is a World of Warcraft server Core to power the NozdormuWoW play through expansions server forked from [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/tree/3.3.5)

It is derived from *TrinityCore*, and by proxy *MaNGOS* the *Massive Network Game Object Server*, and is
based on the code of that project with extensive changes over time to customize it to better suit the NozdormuWoW server.

If you wish to contribute ideas feel free to submit a "suggestion" on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/kaytotes/NozdormuCore/issues).

Following the GPL 2.0 License of *TrinityCore* and *MaNGOS* this core is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged but it would be wise to submit these fixes directly to the [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/tree/3.3.5) project unless it is in some way NozdormuCore specific.

For further information on the TrinityCore project, please visit their project
website at [TrinityCore.org](https://www.trinitycore.org) or the repository at [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/tree/3.3.5).
