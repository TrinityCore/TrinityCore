**NOTE** If your Pull Request is ONLY SQL create an issue instead!
**NOTE** You no longer need to squash your commits, on merge we will squash it for you. (GitHub added a new feature)

**SUGGESTION** If your Pull Request contains SQL give it an impossible date, for example 9999_99_99_99_database.sql. This way it will be free on merge. Myself, i prefer to use 9999_99_99_xxxxx.sql where xxxxx is the id of the pull request, on that way we can merge multiple pull requests containing sql files on a row and rename the files with a single commit.
