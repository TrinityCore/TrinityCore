        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this form! Please make sure to fill all fields, including the Title above.
        For SQL fixes:
        - search for existing issues. If a bug report exists for the issue you are trying to fix, and it's open, post your suggestion there
        - always start suggestion by -- in case previous SQL file has no newline
        - don't modify WDB fields without providing sniffs of those fields (censure guids, character names, anything blizzard can use to identify source)
        - don't hardcode guids (use guid from fixed guid range when adding new objects or creatures)
        - don't DELETE + INSERT to update only few fields of one row
        - don't use database names
        - don't use ' around numbers
        - don't use ( ) if they aren't needed
        - use only one INSERT INTO statement when you add multiple rows to one table, unless you are scripting multiple creatures
        - always include column names in every INSERT INTO statement
        - always make every INSERT INTO statement runnable twice (delete what you insert even if row does not exist, don't use REPLACE INTO)
        - DELETE by guid AND id to be sure we don't delete existing spawns
