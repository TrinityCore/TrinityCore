EventAI documentation: (updated May 19, 2009)
=============================================

EventAI allows users to create new creature scripts entierly within the database.

For the AI to be used, you must first make sure to set AIname for each creature that should use this AI.
UPDATE creature_template SET AIName = 'EventAI' WHERE entry IN (...);


=========================================
Basic structure of EventAI
=========================================

EventAI follows a basic if (Event) then do (Action) format.
Below is the list of current fields of the creature_ai_scripts table.

(Field_Name)                (Description)
id                          This value is merely an incrementing counter of the current Event number. Required for sql queries.
creature_id                 Creature id which should trigger this event.

event_type                  The type of event (see "Event types" below)
event_inverse_phase_mask    Mask with phases this event should NOT trigger in*
event_chance                Percentage chance of triggering the event (1 - 100)
event_flags                 Event flags (repeatable, ... (see below))
event_param1                Variables for the event (depends on event_type)
event_param2
event_param3
event_param4

action1_type                An action to take when the event occurs (see "Action types" below)
action1_param1              Variables used by Action1 (depends on action_type)
action1_param2
action1_param3

action2_type
action2_param1
action2_param2
action2_param3

action3_type
action3_param1
action3_param2
action3_param3

All params are signed 32-bit values (+/- 2147483647). Time values are always in milliseconds.
In case of a percentage value, use value/100 (ie. param = 500 then that means 500%, -50 = -50%)

[*] Phase mask is a bitmask of phases which shouldn't trigger this event. (ie. Phase mask of value 12 (binary 1100) results in triggering this event in phases 0, 1 and all others with exception for phases 2 and 3 (counting from 0).


=========================================
Event types
=========================================

A list of event types EventAI is able to handle.
Each event type has its own specific interpretation of the params that accompany it.
Params are always read in the ascending order (from Param1 to Param3).
Events will not repeat until the creature exits combat or unless EFLAG_REPEATABLE is set.
Some events such as EVENT_T_AGGRO, EVENT_T_DEATH, EVENT_T_SPAWNED, and EVENT_T_EVADE cannot repeat.

Note:
COMBAT ONLY - Means that this event will only trigger durring combat.

=========================================
Target Types
=========================================
Below is the list of current Target types that EventAI can handle.
Target types are used by certain actions and may effect actions differently

(#   Internal Name                      Discription)
0    TARGET_T_SELF                      Self cast
1    TARGET_T_HOSTILE                   Our current target (ie: highest aggro)
2    TARGET_T_HOSTILE_SECOND_AGGRO      Second highest aggro (generaly used for cleaves and some special attacks)
3    TARGET_T_HOSTILE_LAST_AGGRO        Dead last on aggro (no idea what this could be used for)
4    TARGET_T_HOSTILE_RANDOM            Just any random target on our threat list
5    TARGET_T_HOSTILE_RANDOM_NOT_TOP    Any random target except top threat
6    TARGET_T_ACTION_INVOKER            Unit who caused this Event to occur (only works for EVENT_T_AGGRO, EVENT_T_KILL, EVENT_T_DEATH, EVENT_T_SPELLHIT, EVENT_T_OOC_LOS, EVENT_T_FRIENDLY_HP)

=========================================
Cast Flags
=========================================
Below is the list of current Cast Flags that EventAI's spell casting can handle.
Cast flags are handled bitwise. Bit 0 is Interrupt Previous, bit 1 is triggered, etc.
So for example the number "3" (11 in Binary, selecting first 2 options) would mean that this cast has both CAST_INTURRUPT_PREVIOUS and CAST_TRIGGERED.
Another example: the number "5" (101 in Binary, selecting first and third options) would mean that this cast has CAST_INTURRUPT_PREVIOUS and CAST_FORCE_CAST.

(bit#   Decimal     Internal Name                  Discription)
0       1           CAST_INTURRUPT_PREVIOUS        Interrupts any previous spell casting (basicaly makes sure that this spell goes off)
1       2           CAST_TRIGGERED                 Forces the spell to be instant cast and require no mana/reagents.
2       4           CAST_FORCE_CAST                Forces spell to cast even if the target is possibly out of range or the creature is possibly out of mana
3       8           CAST_NO_MELEE_IF_OOM           Prevents creature from entering melee if out of mana or out of range
4       16          CAST_FORCE_TARGET_SELF         Forces the target to cast this spell on itself
5       32          CAST_AURA_NOT_PRESENT          Only casts the spell on the target if the target does not have the aura from that spell on itself already.

NOTE: You can add the numbers in the decimal column to combine flags.
 For example if you wanted to use CAST_NO_MELEE_IF_OOM(8) and CAST_TRIGGERED(2) you would simply use 10 in the cast flags field (8 + 2 = 10).
