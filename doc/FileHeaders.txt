To make things look uniform here's the headers we use for sourcefiles.

 It makes it "prettier" as it's applied to any of the sourcefiles 
(source and headers) , giving us a template licensing-style that we stick to
(or at least keeping in the same style licensewise).

XXXX = startyear
YYYY = active year

Standalone (no previous code from anyone) :
