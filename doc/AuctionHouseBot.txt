Populates the auction houses with items. It can make the game feel a bit more
like official on small servers. Items and prices are chosen randomly based on
the parameters you define. If an auction expires, auctions are deleted quietly.
AHBot will not buy it's own items, and will not receive mail from the AH
or get returned mail.

~~HOW TO CONFIGURE~~
===============================================================================
Step 1.) Create a character that you are going to use as the auction house bot
         character. This character will be the auction's owner for all the
         items created by the bot.
Step 2.) Go into the realm database and note the account number for the
         character.
Step 3.) Go into the characters database and note the character's GUID.
Step 4.) Log in at least once with this character.
         (Do not change the configuration before this)
Step 5.) Tune the configuration options in the configuration file and the
         Database.

#These are the settings in the configuration file:
AuctionHouseBot.DEBUG = 0
AuctionHouseBot.EnableSeller = 0
AuctionHouseBot.EnableBuyer = 0
AuctionHouseBot.UseBuyPriceForSeller = 0
AuctionHouseBot.UseBuyPriceForBuyer = 0
AuctionHouseBot.Account = 0
AuctionHouseBot.GUID = 0
AuctionHouseBot.ItemsPerCycle = 200

AuctionHouseBot.DEBUG enables (1) or disables (0) Debug output
AuctionHouseBot.EnableSeller enables (1) or disables (0) the Seller
AuctionHouseBot.EnableBuyer enables (1) or disables (0) the Buyer
AuctionHouseBot.UseBuyPriceForSeller Use SellPrice (0) or BuyPrice (1) for determining prices
AuctionHouseBot.UseBuyPriceForBuyer Use SellPrice (0) or BuyPrice (1) for determining prices
AuctionHouseBot.Account is the account number (in realmd->account table) of the player you want to run as the auction bot. Note: a value of 0 will disable the bot.
AuctionHouseBot.GUID is the GUID (in characters->characters table) of the player you want to run as the auction bot. Note: a value of 0 will disable the bot.
AuctionHouseBot.ItemsPerCycle determines how many items are added each time AHBot is run (once per minute, by default)

#MinBidPrice(Color) these two control the starting bid as a percent of the buyout price. For example, if MinBidPrice is 30 and MaxBidPrice is 80 the starting bid for the auction will randomly be between 30-80% of the randomly chosen buyout price.
