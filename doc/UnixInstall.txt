Installing TrinityCore is fairly simple on a Linux machine, assuming you 
have all required applications

The most important ones are:

	g++
    gcc
    make
    cmake version 2.6.x or greater
    libmysql++-dev
    mercurial (for checking out the core and database)
    openssl
    libssl-dev
    zlib1g-dev
    libtool
    libmysqlclient15-dev
    patch
    build-essential
    mysql-client
    
Most of these are included on common Linux distros, others you may have 
to install by your self. Please check your distro's repos.

Make a directory to build in, you can call it anything you want like 
build or bin etc, then go into the directory and cmake and make. E.G. 
you created a dir named build ad want to have your finalcompiled product 
installed in /home/trinity/server, an example sequence of commands can 
be :

    cmake ../ -DPREFIX=/home/trinity/server
    make
    make install
    
Thats just about all thats needed. You can however tweak more settings 
than where to install using flags built into our cmake files. Just open 
up CMakeLists.txt in the main folder and take a look at some of the 
flags like

    SCRIPTS --enable or disable trinity script (enabled or disabled by a 1 or 0, enabled by default)
    DEBUG --enable debugging (enabled or disabled by a 1 or 0)
    CLI --enable command line support (enabled or disabled by a 1 or 0, enabled by default)
    PREFIX --prefix directory for install (see example for use)
    CONF_DIR --location for your trinity config files
    CMAKE_C_FLAGS --advanced users only
    CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS --advanced users only


Of course, replace the paths in prefix, conf_dir with the directories 
you wish to install TrinityCore to. The datadir is where maps, DBCs, and 
SQLs are stored. The sysconfdir is where configuration files are stored.

Once TrinityCore is installed you will need to apply database updates 
where necessary. Furthermore, you must configure your installation by 
editing the config files in the sysconfdir.
