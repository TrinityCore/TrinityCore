These are the instructions for installation in a Linux environment.
If you are using Windows, refer to https://www.trinitycore.info/ .

Installing TrinityCore is fairly simple on a Linux machine,
assuming you have all the required applications installed:

https://www.trinitycore.info/display/tc/Requirements

Most of these are included on common Linux distros, you may have to
install others by yourself. Please check your distro's repo for specifics.

Make a directory to build in, you can call it anything you want (like
build or bin etc.), then go into the directory and use cmake and make.
E.g. you created a dir named build and want to have your final compiled product
installed in /home/trinity/server/. An example sequence of commands can be:

    cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/trinity/server -DTOOLS=1 -DWITH_WARNINGS=1
    make
    make install

That's just about all that is needed. You can, however, tweak more settings
than where to install, using flags built into our cmake files. Just open up
CMakeLists.txt in the main folder and take a look at some of the flags like

    SERVERS                 Build worldserver and authserver
    SCRIPTS                 Build core with scripts included
    TOOLS                   Build maps/mmaps/vmaps extraction/assembler tools
    USE_SCRIPTPCH           Use precompiled headers when compiling scripts
    USE_COREPCH             Use precompiled headers when compiling servers
    WITH_WARNINGS           Show all warnings during compile
    WITH_COREDEBUG          Include additional debug-code in core
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX    Set installation directory
    NOJEM                   Do not build with jemalloc (advanced users only)
    CONF_DIR                Set path as default configuration directory
    LIBSDIR                 Set path as default library directory
    CMAKE_C_FLAGS           Set C_FLAGS for compile (advanced users only)
    CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS         Set CXX_FLAGS for compile (advanced users only)
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE        Set build type - the supported modes are:
                            Release, MinSizeRel, RelWithDebInfo, Debug

Of course, replace the paths in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX with the directory you wish to
install TrinityCore to. The datadir is where maps, DBCs, and SQLs are stored.
The sysconfdir is where configuration files are stored.

Once TrinityCore is installed, you will need to apply database updates
where necessary. Furthermore, you must configure your installation by
editing the config files in the sysconfdir.
