These are instructions for installation in a Linux environment, if you are
using Windows refer to https://www.trinitycore.info/

Installing TrinityCore is fairly simple on a Linux machine, assuming you 
have all required applications

https://www.trinitycore.info/display/tc/Requirements

Most of these are included on common Linux distros, others you may have 
to install by your self. Please check your distro's repos.

Make a directory to build in, you can call it anything you want like 
build or bin etc, then go into the directory and cmake and make. E.G. 
you created a dir named build ad want to have your finalcompiled product 
installed in /home/trinity/server, an example sequence of commands can 
be :

    cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/trinity/server -DTOOLS=1 -DWITH_WARNINGS=1
    make
    make install
    
Thats just about all thats needed. You can however tweak more settings 
than where to install using flags built into our cmake files. Just open 
up CMakeLists.txt in the main folder and take a look at some of the 
flags like

    SERVERS             Build worldserver and bnetserver
    SCRIPTS              Build core with scripts included
    TOOLS                Build map/mmaps/vmap extraction/assembler tools
    USE_SCRIPTPCH        Use precompiled headers when compiling scripts
    USE_COREPCH          Use precompiled headers when compiling servers
    WITH_WARNINGS        Show all warnings during compile
    WITH_COREDEBUG       Include additional debug-code in core
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX Set installation directory
    NOJEM                Do not build with jemalloc (advanced users only)
    CONF_DIR             Set path as default configuration directory
    LIBSDIR              Set path as default library directory
    CMAKE_C_FLAGS        Set C_FLAGS for compile (advanced users only)
    CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS      Set CXX_FLAGS for compile (advanced users only)
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE     Set buildtype - the supported modes are :
                         Release, MinSizeRel, RelWithDebInfo, Debug

Of course, replace the paths in CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX with the
directory you wish to install TrinityCore to. The datadir is where maps,
DBCs, and SQLs are stored. The sysconfdir is where configuration files are stored.

Once TrinityCore is installed you will need to apply database updates 
where necessary. Furthermore, you must configure your installation by 
editing the config files in the sysconfdir.
