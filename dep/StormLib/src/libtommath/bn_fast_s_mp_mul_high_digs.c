/* LibTomMath, multiple-precision integer library -- Tom St Denis
 *
 * LibTomMath is a library that provides multiple-precision
 * integer arithmetic as well as number theoretic functionality.
 *
 * The library was designed directly after the MPI library by
 * Michael Fromberger but has been written from scratch with
 * additional optimizations in place.
 *
 * The library is free for all purposes without any express
 * guarantee it works.

/* this is a modified version of fast_s_mul_digs that only produces
 * output digits *above* digs.  See the comments for fast_s_mul_digs
 * to see how it works.
 *
 * This is used in the Barrett reduction since for one of the multiplications
 * only the higher digits were needed.  This essentially halves the work.
 *
 * Based on Algorithm 14.12 on pp.595 of HAC.
