/*  File   : strxnmov.c
    Author : Richard A. O'Keefe.
    Updated: 2 June 1984
    Defines: strxnmov()

    strxnmov(dst, len, src1, ..., srcn, NullS)
    moves the first len characters of the concatenation of src1,...,srcn
    to dst and add a closing NUL character.
    It is just like strnmov except that it concatenates multiple sources.
    Beware: the last argument should be the null character pointer.
    Take VERY great care not to omit it!  Also be careful to use NullS
    and NOT to use 0, as on some machines 0 is not the same size as a
    character pointer, or not the same bit pattern as NullS.

    NOTE
      strxnmov is like strnmov in that it moves up to len
      characters; dst will be padded on the right with one '\0' character.
      if total-string-length >= length then dst[length] will be set to \0
