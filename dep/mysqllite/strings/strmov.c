  strmov(dst, src) moves all the  characters  of  src  (including  the
  closing NUL) to dst, and returns a pointer to the new closing NUL in
  dst.	 The similar UNIX routine strcpy returns the old value of dst,
  which I have never found useful.  strmov(strmov(dst,a),b) moves a//b
  into dst, which seems useful.
