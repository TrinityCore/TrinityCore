        Here we implement an abstraction layer for the simpÄºe requirements
        of the Argon2 code. We only require 3 primitives---thread creation,
        joining, and termination---so full emulation of the pthreads API
        is unwarranted. Currently we wrap pthreads and Win32 threads.

        The API defines 2 types: the function pointer type,
   argon2_thread_func_t,
        and the type of the thread handle---argon2_thread_handle_t.
