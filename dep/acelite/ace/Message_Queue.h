 * @class ACE_Message_Queue_Base
 *
 * @brief Base class for ACE_Message_Queue, which is the central
 * queueing facility for messages in the ACE framework.
 *
 * For all the ACE_Time_Value pointer parameters the caller will
 * block until action is possible if @a timeout == 0.  Otherwise, it
 * will wait until the absolute time specified in *@a timeout
 * elapses.
 *
 * A queue is always in one of three states:
 * . ACTIVATED
 * . DEACTIVATED
 * . PULSED
