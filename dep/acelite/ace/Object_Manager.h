/**
 * @class ACE_Object_Manager
 *
 * @brief Manager for ACE library services and singleton cleanup.
 *
 * The ACE_Object_Manager manages cleanup of objects, typically
 * singletons, at program termination.  In addition to managing
 * the cleanup of the ACE library, it provides an interface for
 * application to register objects to be cleaned up.
 * This class also shuts down ACE library services, so that they
 * can reclaim their storage, at program termination.  It works
 * by creating a static instance whose destructor gets called
 * along with those of all other static objects.  Hooks are
 * provided for application code to register objects and arrays
 * for cleanup, e.g., destruction.  The order of such cleanup
 * calls is in the reverse order of registration, i.e., that
 * last object/array to register gets cleaned up first.
 * The ACE_Object_Manager API includes ACE_Managed_Object.  That
 * class is contained in a separate file because it is a
 * template class, and some compilers require that template and
 * non-template class definitions appear in separate files.
 * Please see ace/Managed_Object.h for a description of that
 * part of the API.  In summary, ACE_Managed_Object provides two
 * adapters, the ACE_Cleanup_Adapter and ACE_Managed_Object
 * template classes for adapting objects of any type to be
 * easily managed by the ACE_Object_Manager.  There are several
 * mechanisms for adapting objects and arrays for cleanup at
 * program termination, in roughly increasing order of ease-of-use:
 * 1) Derive the object's class from ACE_Cleanup.
 * 2) Allow the ACE_Object_Manager to both dynamically allocate
 * and deallocate the object.
 * 3) Provide an <ACE_CLEANUP_FUNC> cleanup hook for the object or
 * array.
 * 4) Allow the ACE_Object_Manager to both preallocate the object
 * or array, either statically in global data or dynamically on
 * the heap, when its singleton instance is construction.
 *
 * There are also several mechanisms for registering objects and
 * arrays for cleanup.  In decreasing order of flexibility and
 * complexity (with the exception of the last mechanism):
 *
 * 1) ACE_Object_Manager::at_exit (void *object,
 * ACE_CLEANUP_FUNC cleanup_hook,
 * void *param);
 * can be used to register any object or array for any
 * cleanup activity at program termination.
 * 2) ACE_Object_Manager::at_exit (ACE_Cleanup *object,
 * void *param = 0);
 * can be used to register an ACE_Cleanup object
 * for any cleanup activity at program termination.
 * The final mechanism is not general purpose, but can only
 * be used to allocate objects and arrays at program startup:
 * 3) ACE_Managed_Object::get_preallocated_object
 * (ACE_Object_Manager::Preallocated_Object id);
 * and
 * ACE_Managed_Object::get_preallocated_array
 * (ACE_Object_Manager::Preallocated_Array id);
 * can only be used to allocate objects at program startup,
 * either in global data or on the heap (selected at compile
 * time).  These are intended to replace static locks, etc.
 * Instead of creating a static ACE_Object_Manager instance, one
 * can alternatively be created on the stack of the main program
 * thread.  It is created just after entry to ::main (int, char
 * *[]), and before any existing code in that function is
 * executed.  To enable this alternative, add #define
 * ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER before including the platform
 * specific config-* file in ace/config.h prior to
 * building the ACE library and your applications.  This #define
 * is enabled in some config files that are supplied with ACE.
 *
 * To ensure a static object manager is used, #undef
 * ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER *after* including the platform
 * specific config-* file.
 * Note that the ACE_Object_Manager _must_ be created before
 * any threads are spawned by the program.
 * If ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER is not #defined, the ACE
 * library creates a static, singleton ACE_Object_Manager instance.
 * The instance is placed in global program data, and constructed
 * via a static object constructor.  If ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER
 * is #defined, the ACE_Object_Manager instance is created on the stack
 * of the main program thread, as noted above.
 *
 * With ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER enabled, the ACE
 * library has no static objects that require destruction.
 * However, there are two drawbacks to using it:
 * 1) main (int, char *[]) must be declared with arguments, even
 * if they're not used.  All of ACE is converted to this, so
 * just applications have to be concerned with it.
 * 2) If there any static objects that depend on those that are
 * cleaned up by the Object_Manager, they'll get cleaned up too
 * late.  The ACE tests do not violate this requirement.
 * However, applications may have trouble with it.
 * NOTE on the use of <::exit> -- <::exit> does not destroy
 * automatic objects.  Therefore, if
 * ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER is enabled, the
 * ACE_Object_Manager instance will *not* be destroyed if
 * <::exit> is called!  However, <ACE_OS::exit> will properly
 * destroy the ACE_Object_Manager.  It is highly recommended
 * that <ACE_OS::exit> be used instead of <::exit>.
 *
 * However, <::exit> and <ACE_OS::exit> are tricky to use
 * properly, especially in multithread programs.  It is much
 * safer to throw an exception (or simulate that effect) that
 * will be caught by <main> instead of calling exit.  Then,
 * <main> can perform any necessary application-specific cleanup
 * and return the status value.  In addition, it's usually best
 * to avoid calling <::exit> and <ACE_OS::exit> from threads
 * other than the main thread.  Thanks to Jeff Greif
 * <jmg@trivida.com> for pointing out that <::exit> doesn't
 * destroy automatic objects, and for developing the
 * recommendations in this paragraph.
 *
 * Instead of creating a static ACE_Object_Manager, or letting
 * ACE create it on the stack of <main> for you, another
 * alternative is to #define
 * ACE_DOESNT_INSTANTIATE_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER.  With that
 * #define, the application must create the ACE_Object_Manager.
 * The recommended way is to call <ACE::init> at the start of
 * the program, and call <ACE::fini> at the end.  Alternatively,
 * the application could explicity construct an
 * ACE_Object_Manager.
