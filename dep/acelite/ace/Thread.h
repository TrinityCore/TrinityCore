 * generally a better idea to use the ACE_Thread_Manager

   * and @a t_handle are set to the thread's ID and handle (?),
   * respectively.  The thread runs at @a priority priority (see
   * below).
   *

   * maximum priority values for the given policy.  If an explicit
   * value is given, it is used.  Note that actual priority values are
   * EXTREMELY implementation-dependent, and are probably best

   * is called, so it must be allocated with global operator new.
