/**
 * @class ACE_Process_Manager
 *
 * @brief Manages a group of processes.
 *
 * This class allows applications to control groups of processes,
 * similar to how the ACE_Thread_Manager controls groups of
 * threads.  Naturally, it doesn't work at all on platforms, such
 * as VxWorks or pSoS, that don't support process.
 * There are two main ways of using ACE_Process_Manager,
 * depending on how involved you wish to be with the termination
 * of managed processes.  If you want processes to simply
 * go away when they're finished, register the ACE_Process_Manager with
 * an ACE_Reactor that can handle notifications of child process exit:
 * @code
 * ACE_Process_Manager mgr;
 * // ...
 * mgr.open (100, ACE_Reactor::instance ());
 * @endcode
 * In this usage scenario, the ACE_Process_Manager will clean up after any
 * processes that it spawns.  (On Unix, this means executing a
 * wait(2) to collect the exit status and avoid zombie
 * processes; on Win32, it means closing the process and thread
 * HANDLEs that are created when CreateProcess is called.)
 *
 * @note When you register a ACE_Process_Manager with a
 * ACE_Reactor, the reactor's notification pipe is used to help reap the
 * available process exit statuses.  Therefore, you must not use a
 * reactor whose notify pipe has been disabled.  Here's the
 * sequence of steps used to reap the exit statuses in this case:
 * -# The ACE_Process_Manager registers a signal handler for
 *    SIGCHLD.
 * -# The SIGCHLD handler, when invoked, uses the ACE_Reactor's
 *    notify() method to inform the ACE_Reactor to wake up.
 * -# The ACE_Reactor calls the ACE_Process_Manager's
 *    handle_input() method; this happens synchronously, not in
 *    signal context.
 * -# The handle_input() method collects all available exit
 *    statuses.
 *
 * If, on the other hand you want to wait "in line" to handle the
 * terminated process cleanup code, call one of the wait functions
 * whenever there might be managed processes that have exited.
 *
 * Note that in either case, ACE_Process_Manager allows you to
 * register an ACE_Event_Handler to be called when a specific
 * spawned process exits, or when any process without a specific
 * ACE_Event_Handler exits.  When a process exits, the
 * appropriate ACE_Event_Handler's handle_input() method is called; the
 * ACE_HANDLE passed is either the process's HANDLE (on Win32),
 * or its pid cast to an ACE_HANDLE (on POSIX).
 * It is also possible to call the wait() functions even when the
 * ACE_Process_Manager is registered with a reactor.
 *
 * @note Be aware that the wait functions are "sloppy" on Unix,
 * because there's no good way to wait for a subset of the
 * children of a process.  The wait functions may end up
 * collecting the exit status of a process that's not managed by
 * the ACE_Process_Manager whose wait() you invoked.  It's best to
 * only use a single ACE_Process_Manager, and to create all
 * subprocesses by calling that manager's spawn() method.
