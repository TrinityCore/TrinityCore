/**
 * @class ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream
 *
 * @brief Defines methods in the ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream abstraction.
 *
 * This class encapsulates the methods and functionality necessary to
 * send and receive data over TLS/SSL.
 * @par
 * Since SSL is record-oriented, some additional steps must be taken
 * to make the ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream interact properly with the
 * Reactor (if one is used) when performing non-blocking IO.  In
 * particular, if ::SSL_pending (ssl), where "ssl" is a pointer to the
 * SSL data structure returned from ACE_SSL_SOCK_Stream::ssl(),
 * returns a non-zero value then the event handler that calls the IO
 * methods in this class should return a value greater than zero to
 * force the Reactor to invoke the event handler before polling for
 * additional events (e.g. blocking on select()).
 *
 * @note The user must currently ensure that only one thread services
 *       a given SSL session at any given time since underlying SSL
 *       implementations, such as OpenSSL, are not entirely
 *       thread-safe or reentrant.
