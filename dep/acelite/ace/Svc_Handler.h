 * This class provides a well-defined interface that the

 * Typically, client applications will subclass ACE_Svc_Handler
 * and do all the interesting work in the subclass.  One thing
 * that the ACE_Svc_Handler does contain is a PEER_STREAM
 * endpoint that is initialized by an ACE_Acceptor or
 * ACE_Connector when a connection is established successfully.
 * This endpoint is used to exchange data between a
 * ACE_Svc_Handler and the peer it is connected with.
