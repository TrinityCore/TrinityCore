 *
 * @brief Implements a Red-Black Tree ADT, according to T. H. Corman,
 * C. E. Leiserson, and R. L. Rivest, "Introduction to Algorithms"
 * 1990, MIT, chapter 14.
 *
 * A number of Changes have been made to this class template
 * in order to conform to the ACE_Hash_Map_Manager_Ex
 * interface.  All previously supported public methods are
 * still part of this class. However, these are marked as
 * DEPRECATED and will be removed from this class in
 * a future version of ACE.  Please migrate your code
 * to the appropriate public methods indicated in the
 * method deprecation comments.
 * This class uses an ACE_Allocator to allocate memory.  The
 * user can make this a persistent class by providing an
 * ACE_Allocator with a persistable memory pool.
 *
 * <b> Requirements and Performance Characteristics</b>
 *   - Internal Structure:
 *       Binary tree
 *   - Duplicates allowed?
 *       No
 *   - Random access allowed?
 *       No
 *   - Search speed:
 *       Log(n)
 *   - Insert/replace speed:
 *       Log(n)
 *   - Iterator still valid after change to container?
 *       Yes, except if the iterated-over element is removed.
 *   - Frees memory for removed elements?
 *       Yes
 *   - Items inserted by:
 *       Value
 *   - Requirements for contained type
 *       -# Default constructor
 *       -# Copy constructor
 *       -# operator=
 *       -# operator==
 *       -# operator<
