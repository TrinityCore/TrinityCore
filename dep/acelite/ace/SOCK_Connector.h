/**
 * @class ACE_SOCK_Connector
 *
 * @brief Defines a factory that actively connects to a remote IP
 * address and TCP port, creating a new @c ACE_SOCK_Stream object.
 *
 * The @c ACE_SOCK_Connector doesn't have a socket of its own,
 * i.e., it simply "borrows" the one from the @c ACE_SOCK_Stream
 * that's being connected.  The reason for this is that the
 * underlying socket API doesn't use a factory socket to connect
 * data mode sockets.  Therefore, there's no need to inherit
 * @c ACE_SOCK_Connector from @c ACE_SOCK.  A nice side-effect of
 * this is that @c ACE_SOCK_Connector objects do not store state so
 * they can be used reentrantly in multithreaded programs.

  /**
   * Actively connect to a peer, producing a connected @c ACE_SOCK_Stream
   * object if the connection succeeds.
   *
   * @param new_stream  The @c ACE_SOCK_Stream object that will be connected
   *                    to the peer.
   * @param remote_sap  The address that we are trying to connect to.
   *                    The protocol family of @c remote_sap is used for
   *                    the connected socket. That is, if @c remote_sap
   *                    contains an IPv6 address, a socket with family
   *                    PF_INET6 will be used, else it will be PF_INET.
   * @param timeout     Pointer to an @c ACE_Time_Value object with amount
   *                    of time to wait to connect. If the pointer is 0
   *                    then the call blocks until the connection attempt
   *                    is complete, whether it succeeds or fails.  If
   *                    *timeout == {0, 0} then the connection is done
   *                    using nonblocking mode.  In this case, if the
   *                    connection can't be made immediately, this method
   *                    returns -1 and errno == EWOULDBLOCK.
   *                    If *timeout > {0, 0} then this is the maximum amount
   *                    of time to wait before timing out; if the specified
   *                    amount of time passes before the connection is made,
   *                    this method returns -1 and errno == ETIME. Note
   *                    the difference between this case and when a blocking
   *                    connect is attempted that TCP times out - in the latter
   *                    case, errno will be ETIMEDOUT.
   * @param local_sap   (optional) The local address to bind to.  If it's
   *                    the default value of @c ACE_Addr::sap_any then the
   *                    OS will choose an unused port.
   * @param reuse_addr  (optional) If the value is 1, the local address
   *                    (@c local_sap) is reused, even if it hasn't been
   *                    cleaned up yet.

   * @param protocol    (optional) If value is 0, default SOCK_STREAM
   *                    protocol is selected by kernel (typically TCP).
