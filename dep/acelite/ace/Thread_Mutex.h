 * @class ACE_Thread_Mutex

 * @brief ACE_Thread_Mutex wrapper (only valid for threads in the same
 * process).
 *
 * This implementation is optimized for locking threads that are
 * in the same process.  It maps to <CRITICAL_SECTION>s on NT
 * and <ACE_mutex_t> with <type> set to <USYNC_THREAD> on UNIX.
 * ACE_Thread_Mutex is recursive on some platforms (like
 * Win32). However, on most platforms (like Solaris) it is not
 * recursive.  To be totally safe and portable, developers
 * should use ACE_Recursive_Thread_Mutex when they need a
 * recursive mutex.
