// destructed.  Which means, once your system is stable, you rarely
// need to pay the price of memory allocation.  On a deterministic

// determined before hand, you can either redefine the memory pool
// size macros to suit your need or constructed the Thread_Manager
// accordingly.  That way, you don't pay the price of memory
// allocation when the system is really doing its job.  OTOH, on
// system with resources constraint, you may want to lower the size of
// ACE_DEFAULT_THREAD_MANAGER_HWM to avoid unused memory hanging

   *
   * @param grp_id      The thread group that the spawned threads are
   *                    added to. If -1 is specified, a new thread group is
   *                    created for the spawned threads.
   *
   * @param stack       An array of @a n pointers to pre-allocated stack space
   *                    for each thread's stack. If specified as 0, the
   *                    platform allocates stack space for each thread. If

   *                    @a stack_size element also be supplied that specifies
   *                    the size of the stack.
   *                    Not all platforms support pre-allocated stacks. If

   *                    allow pre-allocated stack space this parameter is
   *                    ignored.
   *
   * @param stack_size  An array of @a n values which indicate how large
   *                    each thread's stack should be, in bytes.
   *                    If pre-allocated stacks are passed in @a stacks, these
   *                    sizes are for those stacks. If no pre-allocated stacks
   *                    are passed, the stack sizes are specified to the
   *                    operating system to request that it allocate stacks
   *                    of the specified sizes. If an array entry is 0, the
   *                    platform defaults are used for the corresponding thread.
   *                    If a 0 array pointer is specified, platform defaults
   *                    are used for all thread stack sizes.
   *
   * @param thread_handles An array of @a n entries which will receive
   *                    the thread handles of the spawned threads.
   *
   * @param task        The ACE_Task that the spawned threads are associated
   *                    with. If 0, the threads are not associated with an
   *                    ACE_Task. This argument is usually assigned by the
   *                    ACE_Task_Base::activate() method to associate the
   *                    spawned threads with the spawning ACE_Task object.
   *
   * @param thr_name    An array of names to assign to the spawned threads.
   *                    This is only meaningful for platforms that have a
   *                    capacity to name threads (e.g., VxWorks and some
   *                    varieties of Pthreads). This argument is ignored if
   *                    specified as 0 and on platforms that do not have the
   *                    capability to name threads.
   *
   * ACE_Thread_Manager can manipulate threads in groups based on
   * @a grp_id or @a task using functions such as kill_grp() or
   * cancel_task().
