 * @class ACE_Message_Queue
 *
 * @brief A message queuing facility with parameterized synchronization
 * capability. ACE_Message_Queue is modeled after the queueing facilities
 * in System V STREAMs.
 *
 * ACE_Message_Queue is the primary queuing facility for
 * messages in the ACE framework.  It's one template argument parameterizes
 * the queue's synchronization. The argument specifies a synchronization
 * strategy. The two main strategies available for ACE_SYNCH_DECL are:
 *   -# ACE_MT_SYNCH: all operations are thread-safe
 *   -# ACE_NULL_SYNCH: no synchronization and no locking overhead
 *
 * All data passing through ACE_Message_Queue is in the form of
 * ACE_Message_Block objects. @sa ACE_Message_Block.

/**
 * @class ACE_Dynamic_Message_Queue
 *
 * @brief A derived class which adapts the ACE_Message_Queue
 * class in order to maintain dynamic priorities for enqueued
 * <ACE_Message_Blocks> and manage the queue order according
 * to these dynamic priorities.
 *
 * The messages in the queue are managed so as to preserve
 * a logical ordering with minimal overhead per enqueue and
 * dequeue operation.  For this reason, the actual order of
 * messages in the linked list of the queue may differ from
 * their priority order.  As time passes, a message may change
 * from pending status to late status, and eventually to beyond
 * late status.  To minimize reordering overhead under this
 * design force, three separate boundaries are maintained
 * within the linked list of messages.  Messages are dequeued
 * preferentially from the head of the pending portion, then
 * the head of the late portion, and finally from the head
 * of the beyond late portion.  In this way, only the boundaries
 * need to be maintained (which can be done efficiently, as
 * aging messages maintain the same linked list order as they
 * progress from one status to the next), with no reordering
 * of the messages themselves, while providing correct priority
 * ordered dequeueing semantics.
 * Head and tail enqueue methods inherited from ACE_Message_Queue
 * are made private to prevent out-of-order messages from confusing
 * management of the various portions of the queue.  Messages in
 * the pending portion of the queue whose priority becomes late
 * (according to the specific dynamic strategy) advance into
 * the late portion of the queue.  Messages in the late portion
 * of the queue whose priority becomes later than can be represented
 * advance to the beyond_late portion of the queue.  These behaviors
 * support a limited schedule overrun, with pending messages prioritized
 * ahead of late messages, and late messages ahead of beyond late
 * messages.  These behaviors can be modified in derived classes by
 * providing alternative definitions for the appropriate virtual methods.
 * When filled with messages, the queue's linked list should look like:
 * H                                           T
 * |                                           |
 * B - B - B - B - L - L - L - P - P - P - P - P
 * |           |   |       |   |               |
 * BH          BT   LH     LT   PH             PT
 * Where the symbols are as follows:
 * H  = Head of the entire list
 * T  = Tail of the entire list
 * B  = Beyond late message
 * BH = Beyond late messages Head
 * BT = Beyond late messages Tail
 * L  = Late message
 * LH = Late messages Head
 * LT = Late messages Tail
 * P  = Pending message
 * PH = Pending messages Head
 * PT = Pending messages Tail
 * Caveat: the virtual methods enqueue_tail, enqueue_head,
 * and peek_dequeue_head have semantics for the static
 * message queues that cannot be guaranteed for dynamic
 * message queues.  The peek_dequeue_head method just
 * calls the base class method, while the two enqueue
 * methods call the priority enqueue method.  The
 * order of messages in the dynamic queue is a function
 * of message deadlines and how long they are in the
 * queues.  You can manipulate these in some cases to
 * ensure the correct semantics, but that is not a
 * very stable or portable approach (discouraged).
