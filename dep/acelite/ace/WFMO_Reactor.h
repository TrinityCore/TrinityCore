/**
 * @class ACE_WFMO_Reactor
 *
 * @brief An object oriented event demultiplexor and event handler.
 * ACE_WFMO_Reactor is a Windows-only implementation of the ACE_Reactor
 * interface that uses the WaitForMultipleObjects() event demultiplexer.
 *
 * Like the other ACE Reactors, ACE_WFMO_Reactor can schedule timers.
 * It also reacts to signalable handles, such as events (see the documentation
 * for WaitForMultipleObjects() for a complete list of signalable handle
 * types). Therefore, I/O handles are not directly usable for registering
 * for input, output, and exception notification. The exception to this
 * is ACE_SOCK-based handles, which can be registered for input, output, and
 * exception notification just as with other platforms. See Chapter 4 in
 * C++NPv2 for complete details.
 *
 * Note that changes to the state of ACE_WFMO_Reactor are not
 * instantaneous.  Most changes (registration, removal,
 * suspension, and resumption of handles, and changes in
 * ownership) are made when the ACE_WFMO_Reactor reaches a stable
 * state.  Users should be careful, especially when removing
 * handlers.  This is because the ACE_WFMO_Reactor will call
 * handle_close() on the handler when it is finally removed and
 * not when remove_handler() is called.  If the registered handler's pointer
 * is not valid when ACE_WFMO_Reactor calls ACE_Event_Handler::handle_close(),
 * use the DONT_CALL flag with remove_handler(). Preferably, use dynamically
 * allocated event handlers and call "delete this" inside the handle_close()
 * hook method.
 *
 * Note that although multiple threads can concurrently run the
 * ACE_WFMO_Reactor event loop, the concept of the reactor "owner" is still
 * important. Only the owner thread can expire timers and wait on the
 * notifications handle. Thus, be careful to properly set the owner thread
 * when spawning threads to run the event loop while you are using timers
 * or notifications.
