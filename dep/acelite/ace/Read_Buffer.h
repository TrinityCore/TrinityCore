 * @class ACE_Read_Buffer

 * @brief Efficiently reads an arbitrarily large buffer from an input
 * stream up to and including a termination character.  Also
 * performs search/replace on single occurrences a character in
 * the buffer using the principles of Integrated Layer
 * Processing.
 *
 * This implementation is optimized to do a single dynamic
 * allocation and make only one copy of the data. It uses
 * recursion and the run-time stack to accomplish this
 * efficiently.
