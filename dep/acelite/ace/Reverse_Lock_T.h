/**
 * @namespace ACE_Acquire_Method
 *
 * @brief An enum namespace.
 *
 * These enums should have been inside the reverse lock class, but
 * some lame compilers cannot handle enums inside template classes.
 *
 * The METHOD_TYPE is used to indicate which acquire() method will be
 * called on the real lock when the release() method is called on the
 * reverse lock. REGULAR indicated the acquire() method, READ
 * indicates the acquire_read() method, and WRITE indicates the
 * acquire_write() method.  Note that the try_*() methods are not
 * represented here because we have to make sure that the release()
 * method on the reverse lock acquires a lock on the real lock.

/**
 * @class ACE_Reverse_Lock
 *
 * @brief A reverse (or anti) lock.
 *
 * This is an interesting adapter class that changes a lock into
 * a reverse lock, i.e., <acquire> on this class calls <release>
 * on the lock, and <release> on this class calls <acquire> on
 * the lock.
 * One motivation for this class is when we temporarily want to
 * release a lock (which we have already acquired) but then
 * reacquire it soon after.  An alternative design would be to
 * add a Anti_Guard or Reverse_Guard class which would <release>
 * on construction and <acquire> destruction.  However, there
 * are *many* varieties of the Guard class and this design
 * choice would lead to at least 6 new classes.  One new
 * ACE_Reverse_Lock class seemed more reasonable.
