/**
 * @class ACE_High_Res_Timer
 *
 * @brief A high resolution timer class wrapper that encapsulates
 * OS-specific high-resolution timers, such as those found on
 * Solaris, AIX, Win32/Pentium, and VxWorks.
 *
 * Most of the member functions don't return values.  The only
 * reason that one would fail is if high-resolution time isn't
 * supported on the platform.  To avoid impacting performance
 * and complicating the interface, in that case,
 * <ACE_OS::gettimeofday> is used instead.
 * The global scale factor is required for platforms that have
 * high-resolution timers that return units other than
 * microseconds, such as clock ticks.  It is represented as a
 * static u_long, can only be accessed through static methods,
 * and is used by all instances of High Res Timer.  The member
 * functions that return or print times use the global scale
 * factor.  They divide the "time" that they get from
 * <ACE_OS::gethrtime> by global_scale_factor_ to obtain the
 * time in microseconds.  Its units are therefore 1/microsecond.
 * On Windows the global_scale_factor_ units are 1/millisecond.
 * There's a macro <ACE_HR_SCALE_CONVERSION> which gives the
 * units/second.  Because it's possible that the units/second
 * changes in the future, it's recommended to use it instead
 * of a "hard coded" solution.
 * Dependent on the platform and used class members, there's a
 * maximum elapsed period before overflow (which is not checked).
 * Look at the documentation with some members functions.
 * On some (most?) implementations it's not recommended to measure
 * "long" timeperiods, because the error's can accumulate fast.
 * This is probably not a problem profiling code, but could be
 * on if the high resolution timer class is used to initiate
 * actions after a "long" timeout.
 * On Solaris, a scale factor of 1000 should be used because its
 * high-resolution timer returns nanoseconds.  However, on Intel
 * platforms, we use RDTSC which returns the number of clock
 * ticks since system boot.  For a 200MHz cpu, each clock tick
 * is 1/200 of a microsecond; the global_scale_factor_ should
 * therefore be 200 or 200000 if it's in unit/millisecond.
 * On Windows ::QueryPerformanceCounter() is used, which can be a
 * different implementation depending on the used windows HAL
 * (Hardware Abstraction Layer).  On some it uses the PC "timer chip"
 * while it uses RDTSC on others.
 * @note The elapsed time calculations in the print methods use
 * ACE_hrtime_t values.  Those methods do _not_ check for overflow!
 * @note Gabe <begeddov@proaxis.com> raises this issue regarding
 * <ACE_OS::gethrtime>: on multi-processors, the processor that
 * you query for your @c timer.stop() value might not be the one
 * you queried for @c timer.start().  Its not clear how much
 * divergence there would be, if any.
 * This issue is not mentioned in the Solaris 2.5.1 gethrtime
 * man page.
 * A RDTSC NOTE: RDTSC is the Intel Pentium read-time stamp counter
 * and is actualy a 64 bit clock cycle counter, which is increased
 * with every cycle.  It has a low overhead and can be read within
 * 16 (pentium) or 32 (pentium II,III,...) cycles, but it doesn't
 * serialize the processor, which could give wrong timings when
 * profiling very short code fragments.
 * Problematic is that some power sensitive devices
 * (laptops for example, but probably also embedded devices),
 * do change the cycle rate while running.
 * Some pentiums can run on (at least) two clock frequency's.
 * Another problem arises with multiprocessor computers, there
 * are reports that the different RDTSC's are not always kept
 * in sync.
 * A windows "timer chip" NOTE: (8254-compatible real-time clock)
 * When ::QueryPerformanceCounter() uses the 8254 it has a
 * frequency off about 1.193 Mhz (or sometimes 3.579 Mhz?) and
 * reading it requires some time (several thousand cycles).
