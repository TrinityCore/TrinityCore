 * @class ACE_Service_Config
 *
 * @brief Supplies common server operations for dynamic and static
 * configuration of service.
 *
 * The ACE_Service_Config uses the Monostate pattern.  Therefore,
 * you can only have one of these instantiated per-process. It
 * represents the process-wide collection of services, which is
 * typicaly shared among all other configurable entities. The only
 * ACE_Service_Config instance is registered with and owned by the
 * ACE_Object_Manager.
 *
 * By contrast, the ACE_Service_Gestalt represents the collection
 * of services, pertaining to a configurable entity. Typicaly, a
 * "configurable entity" is an instance, which owns an instance of
 * ACE_Service_Gestalt in order to ensure full controll over the
 * services it needs.
 *
 * Another facet of ACE_Service_Config is that for a given thread,
 * it provides access to its current, process-global
 * ACE_Service_Gestalt instance through its curent() method.
 *
 * @note The signal_handler_ static member is allocated by the
 * ACE_Object_Manager.  The ACE_Service_Config constructor
 * uses signal_handler_.  Therefore, if the program has any
 * static ACE_Service_Config objects, there might be
 * initialization order problems.  They can be minimized, but
 * not eliminated, by _not_ #defining
 * ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER.

   *        execute a @c chroot() to the appropriate directory.
   *        @sa ACE::daemonize().
   * - '-d' Turn on debugging mode
   * - '-f' Specifies a configuration file name other than the default
   *        svc.conf. Can be specified multiple times to use multiple files.
   *        If any configuration file is provided with this option then
   *        the default svc.conf will be ignored.
   * - '-k' Specifies the rendezvous point to use for the ACE distributed
   *        logger.
   * - '-y' Explicitly enables the use of static services. This flag
   *        overrides the @a ignore_static_svcs parameter value.
   * - '-n' Explicitly disables the use of static services. This flag
   *        overrides the @a ignore_static_svcs parameter value.
   * - '-p' Specifies a pathname which is used to store the process id.
   * - '-s' Specifies a signal number other than SIGHUP to trigger reprocessing
   *        of the configuration file(s). Ignored for platforms that do not
   *        have POSIX signals, such as Windows.
   * - '-S' Specifies a service directive string. Enclose the string in quotes
   *        and escape any embedded quotes with a backslash. This option
   *        specifies service directives without the need for a configuration
   *        file. Can be specified multiple times.

   * and from '-S' option are processed together in the following order. First,
   * all files are processed in the order they are specified in @a argv
   * parameter. Second, all directive strings are executed in the order the
   * directives appear in @a argv parameter.

   * @param ignore_static_svcs   If true then static services are not loaded,
   *                             otherwise, they are loaded.

 * @class ACE_Service_Config_Guard
 *
 * @brief A guard class, designed to be instantiated on the stack.
 *
 * Instantiating it with a specific configuration ensures any references to
 * ACE_Service_Config::instance(), even when occuring in static constructors,
 * will allways access the designated configuration instance.
 * This comes very handy when a dynamic service also registers any static
 * services of its own and their static factories.
