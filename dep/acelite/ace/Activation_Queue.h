 * Maintains a priority-ordered queue of ACE_Method_Request objects.
 * A scheduler class (often derived from ACE_Task) subsequently removes
 * each method request and invokes its @c call() method.
 *
 * This class is discussed in depth in the Active Object chapter
 * of POSA2. In that book, it is referred to as an Activation List.

   * Initializes a new activation queue.
   *
   * @param new_queue The activation queue uses an ACE_Message_Queue to
   *                  queue and order the method requests. If this argument
   *                  is 0, a new ACE_Message_Queue is created for this
   *                  object's use and will be deleted when this object is
   *                  destroyed. If a non-zero pointer is supplied, the
   *                  passed object will be used and will not be deleted when
   *                  this object is destroyed. If an ACE_Task is being created
   *                  to act as the scheduler, for instance, its
   *                  ACE_Message_Queue pointer can be passed to this object.
   * @param alloc     Optional, the allocator to use when allocating
   *                  ACE_Message_Block instances that wrap the method requests
   *                  queued to this activation queue. Defaults to
   *                  ACE_Allocator::instance().
   * @param db_alloc  Optional, the allocator to use when allocating
   *                  data blocks for the ACE_Message_Block instances that
   *                  wrap the method requests queued to this activation queue.
   *                  Defaults to ACE_Allocator::instance().
