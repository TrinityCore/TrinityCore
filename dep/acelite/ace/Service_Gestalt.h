/**
 * @class ACE_Service_Gestalt
 *
 * @brief Supplies common server operations for dynamic and static
 * configuration of services.
 *
 * The Gestalt embodies the concept of configuration context. On one
 * hand, it is a flat namespace, where names correspond to a Service
 * Object instance. A Gestalt owns the Service Repository instance,
 * which in turn owns the Service Object instances.
 *
 * Another aspect of a Gestalt is its responsibility for
 * record-keeping and accounting for the meta-data, necessary for
 * locating, removing or instantiating a service.
 *
 * A repository underlies an instance of a gestalt and its lifetime
 * may or may not be bounded by the lifetime of the gestalt, that owns
 * it. This feature is important for the derived classes and the
 * Service Config in particular.

   * This is the primary entry point into the ACE_Service_Config (the

   * arguments that are valid in a call to this method include:
   *
   * - '-b' Option to indicate that we should be a daemon. Note that when
   *        this option is used, the process will be daemonized before the
   *        service configuration file(s) are read. During daemonization,
   *        (on POSIX systems) the current directory will be changed to "/"
   *        so the caller should either fully specify the file names, or
   *        execute a @c chroot() to the appropriate directory.
   *        @sa ACE::daemonize().
   * - '-d' Turn on debugging mode
   * - '-f' Specifies a configuration file name other than the default
   *        svc.conf. Can be specified multiple times to use multiple files.
   *        If any configuration file is provided with this option then
   *        the default svc.conf will be ignored.
   * - '-k' Specifies the rendezvous point to use for the ACE distributed
   *        logger.
   * - '-y' Explicitly enables the use of static services. This flag
   *        overrides the @a ignore_static_svcs parameter value.
   * - '-n' Explicitly disables the use of static services. This flag
   *        overrides the @a ignore_static_svcs parameter value.
   * - '-p' Specifies a pathname which is used to store the process id.
   * - '-s' Specifies a signal number other than SIGHUP to trigger reprocessing
   *        of the configuration file(s). Ignored for platforms that do not
   *        have POSIX signals, such as Windows.
   * - '-S' Specifies a service directive string. Enclose the string in quotes
   *        and escape any embedded quotes with a backslash. This option
   *        specifies service directives without the need for a configuration
   *        file. Can be specified multiple times.
   *
   * Note: Options '-f' and '-S' complement each other. Directives
   * from files and from '-S' option are processed together in the
   * following order. First, the default file "./svc.conf" is
   * evaluated if not ignored, then all files are processed in the
   * order they are specified in '-f' @a argv parameter. Finally, all
   * '-S' directive strings are executed in the order the directives
   * appear in @a argv parameter.
   *
   * If no files or directives are added via the '-f' and '-S'
   * arguments, and the default file is not ignored, it will be
   * evaluated whether it exists or not, possibly causing a failure
   * return. If any other directives are added then the default file
   * will be evaluated only if it exists.
   *
   * @param argc The number of commandline arguments.
   * @param argv The array with commandline arguments
   * @param logger_key   Indicates where to write the logging output,
   *                     which is typically either a STREAM pipe or a
   *                     socket address.
   * @param ignore_static_svcs   If true then static services are not loaded,
   *                             otherwise, they are loaded.
   * @param ignore_default_svc_conf_file  If false then the @c ./svc.conf
   *                                      configuration file will be ignored.
   * @param ignore_debug_flag If false then the application is responsible
   *                          for setting the @c ACE_Log_Msg::priority_mask
   *                          appropriately.
   *
   * @retval -1   A configuration file is not found or cannot
   *              be opened (errno is set accordingly).
   * @retval  0   Success.
