 *
 *
 * A prototype mechanism that allow all ACE objects to be registered
 * with a central in-memory "database" that can dump the state of all
 * live ACE objects (e.g., from within a debugger).
 *
 * The macros which allow easy registration and removal of objects to be
 * dumped (ACE_REGISTER_OBJECT and ACE_REMOVE_OBJECT) are turned into
 * no-ops by compiling with the ACE_NDEBUG macro defined. This allows
 * usage to be removed in "release mode" builds without changing code.
 *
 * There are several interesting aspects to this design:
 *
 * 1. It uses the External Polymorphism pattern to avoid having to
 *  derive all ACE classes from a common base class that has virtual
 *  methods (this is crucial to avoid unnecessary overhead).  In
 *  addition, there is no additional space added to ACE objects
 *  (this is crucial to maintain binary layout compatibility).
 *
 * 2. This mechanism can be conditionally compiled in order to
 *  completely disable this feature entirely.  Moreover, by
 *  using macros there are relatively few changes to ACE code.
 *
 * 3. This mechanism copes with single-inheritance hierarchies of
 *  dumpable classes.  In such cases we typically want only one
 *  dump, corresponding to the most derived instance.  Thanks to
 *  Christian Millour (chris@etca.fr) for illustrating how to do
 *  this.  Note, however, that this scheme doesn't generalize to
 *  work with multiple-inheritance or virtual base classes.
 *
 * Future work includes:
 *
 * 1. Using a dynamic object table rather than a static table
 *
 * 2. Adding support to allow particular classes of objects to
 *  be selectively dumped.
