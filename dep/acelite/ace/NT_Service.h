/**
 * @class ACE_NT_Service
 *
 * @brief Provide the base class which defines the interface for controlling
 * an NT service.
 *
 * NT Services can be implemented using the framework defined by
 * the ACE_NT_Service class, and the macros defined in this file.
 * Some quick refresher notes on NT Services:
 *
 *   - The main program defines an array of entries describing the
 *     services offered.  The ACE_NT_SERVICE_ENTRY macro can help with
 *     this.
 *   - For each service, a separate ServiceMain and Handler function
 *     need to be defined.  These are taken care of by the
 *     ACE_NT_SERVICE_DEFINE macro.
 *   - When the main program/thread calls
 *     StartServiceCtrlDispatcher, NT creates a thread for each
 *     service, and runs the ServiceMain function for the service in
 *     that new thread.  When that thread exits, the service is gone.
 *
 *   To use this facility, you could derive a class from
 *   ACE_Service_Object (if you want to start via ACE's service
 *   configurator), or use any other class to run when the image
 *   starts (assuming that NT runs the image).  You must set up an
 *   NT SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY array to define your service(s).  You
 *   can use the ACE_NT_SERVICE_... macros defined below for this.
 *
 *   A SERVICE_TABLE might look like this:
 *       ACE_NT_SERVICE_REFERENCE(Svc1);  // If service is in another file
 *       SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY myServices[] = {
 *                    ACE_NT_SERVICE_ENTRY ("MyNeatService", Svc1),
 *                    { 0, 0 } };
 *
 *   In the file where your service(s) are implemented, use the
 *   ACE_NT_SERVICE_DEFINE macro to set up the following:
 *    1. A pointer to the service's implementation object (must be derived
 *       from ACE_NT_Service).
 *    2. The service's Handler function (forwards all requests to the
 *       ACE_NT_Service-derived object's handle_control function).
 *    3. The service's ServiceMain function.  Creates a new instance
 *       of the ACE_NT_Service-derived class SVCCLASS, unless one has
 *       been created already.
 *
 *   If you are using all the default constructor values, you can
 *   let the generated ServiceMain function create the object, else
 *   you need to create it by hand before calling
 *   StartServiceCtrlDispatcher.  Set the pointer so ServiceMain
 *   won't create another one.  Another reason you may want to do
 *   the object creation yourself is if you want to also implement
 *   suspend and resume functions (the ones inherited from
 *   ACE_Service_Object) to do something intelligent to the services
 *   which are running, like call their handle_control functions to
 *   request suspend and resume actions, similar to what NT would do
 *   if a Services control panel applet would do if the user clicks
 *   on Suspend.

  // running state, completely shut down, etc.) or get "stuck" before
  // returning.  If the time is supplied, it specifies how long to
  // wait for the service to reach a steady state, and on return, it
  // is updated to the service's last reported wait hint.  So, if you
  // want to control the waiting yourself (for example, you want to
  // react to UI events during the wait) specify a @a wait_time of (0,
  // 0) and use the updated time to know when to check the service's
  // state again.  NOTE!!!! The wait_time things don't work yet.  The

  // made successfully.  The service may refuse to change, or not do
  // what you wanted; so if you need to know, supply a <svc_state>
  // pointer to receive the service's reported last state on return
  // and check it to see if it's what you want.  The functions only
  // return -1 when the actual request to the service is refused -
  // this would include privilege restrictions and if the service is

   * some other state, or exits.  If @a wait_time is supplied, it is
