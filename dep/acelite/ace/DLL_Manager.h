/**
 * @class ACE_DLL_Handle
 *
 * @brief Provides an abstract interface for handling various DLL
 * operations.
 *
 * This class is an wrapper over the various methods for utilizing a
 * dynamically linked library (DLL), which is called a shared library
 * on some platforms.  It is refcounted and managed by
 * ACE_DLL_Manager, so there will only be a single instance of this
 * class for each dll loaded, no matter how many instances of ACE_DLL
 * an application has open.  Operations open(), close(), and symbol()
 * have been implemented to help opening/closing and extracting symbol
 * information from a DLL, respectively.
 *
 * Most of this class came from the original ACE_DLL class.  ACE_DLL
 * is now just an interface that passed all it's calls either directly
 * or via ACE_DLL_Manager to this class for execution.

  /**
   * This method opens and dynamically links a library/DLL.
   * @param dll_name  The filename or path of the DLL to load. ACE will
   *        attempt to apply the platform's standard library/DLL prefixes
   *        and suffixes, allowing a simple, unadorned name to be passed
   *        regardless of platform. The set of name transforms is listed
   *        below. A @i decorator is a platform's name designator for a debug
   *        vs release build. For example, on Windows it is usually "d".
   *        @li Prefix + name + decorator + suffix
   *        @li Prefix + name + suffix
   *        @li Name + decorator + suffix
   *        @li Name + suffix
   *        @li Name
   *        Note that the transforms with @i decorator will be avoided if
   *        ACE is built with the @c ACE_DISABLE_DEBUG_DLL_CHECK config macro.
   *
   *        @Note There is another mode for locating library/DLL files that
   *        was used in old versions of ACE. The alternate method builds
   *        more combinations of pathname by combining the names transforms
   *        above with locations listed in the platform's standard "path"
   *        locations (e.g., @c LD_LIBRARY_PATH). It can be enabled by building
   *        ACE with the @c ACE_MUST_HELP_DLOPEN_SEARCH_PATH config macro.
   *        Use of this option is discouraged since it avoids the standard
   *        platform search options and security mechanisms.
   *
   * @param open_mode  Flags to alter the actions taken when loading the DLL.
   *        The possible values are:
   *        @li @c RTLD_LAZY (this the default): loads identifier symbols but
   *            not the symbols for functions, which are loaded dynamically
   *            on demand.
   *        @li @c RTLD_NOW: performs all necessary relocations when
   *            @a dll_name is first loaded
   *        @li @c RTLD_GLOBAL: makes symbols available for relocation
   *            processing of any other DLLs.
   * @param handle If a value other than @c ACE_INVALID_HANDLE is supplied,
   *        this object is assigned the specified handle instead of attempting
   *        to open the specified @a dll_name.
   * @retval -1 On failure
   * @retval 0 On success.

 *
 * This class is a singleton whose lifetime is managed by the
 * ACE_Framework_Repository.  Although it is normally meant to be
 * used directly only by ACE_DLL, applications can call the unload_policy()
 * methods in order get/set the the dll unload policy.  Unload policies include
 * per_process/per-dll and eager/lazy.  Dlls can export set their own policy
 * by using the ACE_DLL_UNLOAD_POLICY macro found in config-all.h.  If a dll
 * choses to set an unload policy, it will be used when the per-dll policy
 * (the default) is in effect.  If the per-dll policy is in effect and a dll
 * has not chosen to set a policy, the current per-process policy will be
 * used.
 *
 * The following policy macros are provided in config-all.h:
 *
 *  ACE_DLL_UNLOAD_POLICY_PER_PROCESS - Per-process policy that unloads dlls
 *  eagerly.
 *
 *  ACE_DLL_UNLOAD_POLICY_PER_DLL - Apply policy on a per-dll basis.  If the
 *  dll doesn't use one of the macros below, the current per-process policy
 *  will be used.
 *
 *  ACE_DLL_UNLOAD_POLICY_LAZY - Don't unload dll when refcount reaches
 *  zero, i.e., wait for either an explicit unload request or program exit.
 *
 *  ACE_DLL_UNLOAD_POLICY_DEFAULT - Default policy allows dlls to control
 *  their own destinies, but will unload those that don't make a choice eagerly.
