/**
 * @class ACE_Log_Msg_Callback
 *
 * @brief An interface class used to get logging callbacks.
 *
 *     Users who are interested in getting the logging messages
 *     directly, can subclass this interface and override the log()
 *     method. They must then register their subclass with the
 *     Log_Msg class and make sure that they turn on the
 *     ACE_Log_Msg::MSG_CALLBACK flag.
 *
 *     Your log() routine is called with an instance of
 *     ACE_Log_Record.  From this class, you can get the log
 *     message, the verbose log message, message type, message
 *     priority, and so on.
 *
 *     Remember that there is one Log_Msg object per thread.
 *     Therefore, you may need to register your callback object with
 *     many ACE_Log_Msg objects (and have the correct
 *     synchronization in the log() method) or have a separate
 *     callback object per Log_Msg object.  Moreover,
 *     ACE_Log_Msg_Callbacks are not inherited when a new thread
 *     is spawned because it might have been allocated off of the
 *     stack of the original thread, in which case all hell would
 *     break loose...  Therefore, you'll need to reset these in each
 *     new thread.
