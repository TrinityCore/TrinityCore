 *
 * @brief This class is a factory for starting off asynchronous writes
 *    on a UDP socket. The UDP socket must be "connected", as there is
 *    no facility for specifying the destination address on each send
 *    operation.
 *
 *     Once @c open() is called, multiple asynchronous writes can
 *     started using this class.  A ACE_Asynch_Write_Stream::Result
 *     will be passed back to the associated completion handler when the
 *     asynchronous write completes through the
 *     ACE_Handler::handle_write_stream() callback.

  /** This method queues an asynchronous send.  Up to
   * @a message_block->total_length bytes will be sent, beginning at the
   * read pointer. The @a message_block read pointer will be updated to
   * reflect the sent bytes if the send operation is successful completed.
   *
   * Priority of the operation is specified by @a priority. On POSIX,
   * this is supported. Works like @c nice in Unix. Negative values are not
   * allowed. 0 means priority of the operation same as the process
   * priority. 1 means priority of the operation is one less than
   * process, etc.
   * @a signal_number is a no-op on non-POSIX4 systems.
   *
   * @note Unlike the Windows version of this facility, no indication of
   * immediate success can be returned, and @a number_of_bytes_sent is
   * never used.
   *
   * @arg flags Not used.
   * @arg addr Not used.
   * @retval 0  The IO will complete asynchronously.
   * @retval -1 There was an error; see @c errno to get the error code.
