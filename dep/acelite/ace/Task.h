   * By default, or if <{priority}> is set to
   * ACE_DEFAULT_THREAD_PRIORITY, an "appropriate" priority value for
   * the given scheduling policy (specified in <{flags}>, e.g.,
   * <THR_SCHED_DEFAULT>) is used.  This value is calculated
   * dynamically, and is the median value between the minimum and
   * maximum priority values for the given policy.  If an explicit
   * value is given, it is used.  Note that actual priority values are
   * EXTREMEMLY implementation-dependent, and are probably best
   * avoided.

   * thread_handles that will be assigned the values of the thread
   * handles being spawned.  Returns -1 on failure (@c errno will

   *
   * Assigning @a task allows you to associate the newly spawned
   * threads with an instance of ACE_Task_Base.  If @a task == 0, then
   * the new threads are associated automatically with @c this
   * ACE_Task_Base.  Setting the @a task argument to value other than
   * @c this makes the thread manipulating methods, such as wait(),
   * suspend(), resume(), useless.  Threads spawned with user
   * specified @a task value must therefore be manipulated thru
   * ACE_Thread_Manager directly.
   *
   * If @a stack != 0 it is assumed to be an array of @a n pointers to
   * the base of the stacks to use for the threads being spawned.
   * Likewise, if @a stack_size != 0 it is assumed to be an array of
   * @a n values indicating how big each of the corresponding @a stacks
   * are.
