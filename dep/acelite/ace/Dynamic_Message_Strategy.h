/**
 * @class ACE_Dynamic_Message_Strategy
 *
 * @brief An abstract base class which provides dynamic priority
 * evaluation methods for use by the ACE_Dynamic_Message_Queue
 * class or any other class which needs to manage the priorities
 * of a collection of ACE_Message_Blocks dynamically.
 *
 * Methods for deadline and laxity based priority evaluation are
 * provided.  These methods assume a specific partitioning of
 * the message priority number into a higher order dynamic bit
 * field and a lower order static priority bit field.  The
 * default partitioning assumes an unsigned dynamic message
 * priority field of 22 bits and an unsigned static message
 * priority field of 10 bits.  This corresponds to the initial
 * values of the static class members.  To provide a different
 * partitioning, assign a different set of values to the static
 * class members before using the static member functions.
