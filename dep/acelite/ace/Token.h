/**
 * @class ACE_Token
 *
 * @brief Class that acquires, renews, and releases a synchronization
 * token that is serviced in strict FIFO/LIFO ordering and that also
 * supports (1) recursion and (2) readers/writer semantics.
 *
 * This class is a more general-purpose synchronization mechanism
 * than many native OS mutexes.  For example, it implements
 * "recursive mutex" semantics, where a thread that owns the token
 * can reacquire it without deadlocking.  If the same thread calls
 * <acquire> multiple times, however, it must call <release> an
 * equal number of times before the token is actually released.
 * Threads that are blocked awaiting the token are serviced in
 * strict FIFO/LIFO order as other threads release the token (Solaris
 * and Pthread mutexes don't strictly enforce an acquisition
 * order).  There are two lists within the class.  Write
 * acquires always have higher priority over read acquires.  Which
 * means, if you use both write/read operations, care must be
 * taken to avoid starvation on the readers.  Notice that the
 * read/write acquire operations do not have the usual semantic of
 * reader/writer locks.  Only one reader can acquire the token at
 * a time (which is different from the usual reader/writer locks
 * where several readers can acquire a lock at the same time as
 * long as there is no writer waiting for the lock).  We choose
 * the names to (1) borrow the semantic to give writers higher
 * priority and (2) support a common interface for all locking
 * classes in ACE.
