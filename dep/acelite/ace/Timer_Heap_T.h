 * This implementation uses a heap-based callout queue of
 * absolute times.  Therefore, in the average and worst case,
 * scheduling, canceling, and expiring timers is O(log N) (where
 * N is the total number of timers).  In addition, we can also
 * preallocate as many @c ACE_Timer_Node objects as there are slots
 * in the heap.  This allows us to completely remove the need for
 * dynamic memory allocation, which is important for real-time
 * systems.
