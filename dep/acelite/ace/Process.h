 *
 * @brief Process Options
 *
 * This class controls the options passed to <CreateProcess> (or <fork>
 * and <exec>).
 * Notice that on Windows CE, creating a process merely means
 * instantiating a new process.  You can't set the handles (since
 * there's no stdin, stdout and stderr,) specify process/thread
 * options, set environment,...  So, basically, this class only
 * set the command line and nothing else.
 * Notice that on UNIX platforms, if the <setenv> is used, the
 * <spawn> is using the <execve> system call. It means that the
 * <command_line> should include a full path to the program file
 * (<execve> does not search the PATH).  If <setenv> is not used
 * then, the <spawn> is using the <execvp> which searches for the
 * program file in the PATH variable.
