/**
 * @class ACE_Acceptor
 *
 * @brief Abstract factory for creating a service handler
 * (SVC_HANDLER), accepting into the SVC_HANDLER, and
 * activating the SVC_HANDLER.
 *
 * Implements the basic strategy for passively establishing
 * connections with clients.  An ACE_Acceptor is parameterized
 * by concrete types that conform to the interfaces of
 * PEER_ACCEPTOR and SVC_HANDLER.  The PEER_ACCEPTOR is
 * instantiated with a transport mechanism that passively
 * establishes connections.  The SVC_HANDLER is instantiated
 * with a concrete type that performs the application-specific
 * service.  An ACE_Acceptor inherits from ACE_Service_Object,
 * which in turn inherits from ACE_Event_Handler.  This enables
 * the ACE_Reactor to dispatch the ACE_Acceptor's handle_input
 * method when connection events occur.  The handle_input method
 * performs the ACE_Acceptor's default creation, connection
 * establishment, and service activation strategies.  These
 * strategies can be overridden by subclasses individually or as
 * a group.

/**
 * @class ACE_Oneshot_Acceptor
 *
 * @brief Generic factory for passively connecting clients and creating

 * template.
 *
 * This class works similarly to the regular ACE_Acceptor, but
 * with the following differences:
 *  -# ACE_Oneshot_Acceptor doesn't automatically register itself with the
 *     ACE_Reactor; the caller is expected to call the accept() method
 *     directly. Since a later call to accept() may require a reactor,
 *     the constructor and open() methods both accept an ACE_Reactor pointer
 *     which is saved in case it's needed in accept().
 *  -# ACE_Oneshot_Acceptor doesn't need an ACE_Creation_Strategy (because
 *     the user supplies the SVC_HANDLER) or an ACE_Accept_Strategy (because
 *     this class only accepts one connection and then removes all traces of
 *     itself from the ACE_Reactor if it was registered for asynchronous
 *     accepts).
 *
 * The usage model for ACE_Oneshot_Acceptor is:
 *  - Instantiate an object and establish its local address to listen at.
 *    This can be accomplished using either the address-accepting constructor
 *    (but there's no error indication) or the default constructor followed
 *    by a call to open().
 *  - Call the accept() method. This will attempt to accept a connection
 *    immediately. If there is no immediately available connection to accept,
 *    behavior is governed by the ACE_Synch_Options argument passed to open().
