 * @class ACE_Lock

 * locking API that is supported by all the ACE synchronization
 * mechanisms.
 *
 * This class is typically used in conjunction with the
 * ACE_Lock_Adapter in order to provide a polymorphic
 * interface to the ACE synchronization mechanisms (e.g.,
 * ACE_Mutex, ACE_Semaphore, ACE_RW_Mutex, etc).  Note that
 * the reason that all of ACE doesn't use polymorphic locks is
 * that (1) they add ~20% extra overhead for virtual function
 * calls and (2) objects with virtual functions can't be placed
 * into shared memory.
