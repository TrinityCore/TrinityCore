libmpq (0.4.2-svn288-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ babyface ]
  * Due to the nature of MPQ archives which can have valid block entries
  * removed function libmpq__init() and libmpq__shutdown(), because they
    are no longer required and libmpq__file_name(), because it is up to
    the application to provide listfile support
  * updated documentation to latest API changes
  * removed API documentation for removed function prototypes
  * removed no longer required files from target

  [ forrestv ]
  * mpq.py fix
  * spelling - huffmann to huffman
  * changed pkware/pkzip to pkzip and used constants instead of numbers
    in extract.c
  * sanified huffman decoder a bit
  * cleanup + update of mpq.py
  * Added support for library finding on platforms besides Linux.
  * python bindings - sequence methods on Archive, example code
