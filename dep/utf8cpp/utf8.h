/*
To control the C++ language version used by the library, you can define UTF_CPP_CPLUSPLUS macro
and set it to one of the values used by the __cplusplus predefined macro.

For instance,
    #define UTF_CPP_CPLUSPLUS 199711L
will cause the UTF-8 CPP library to use only types and language features available in the C++ 98 standard.
Some library features will be disabled.

If you leave UTF_CPP_CPLUSPLUS undefined, it will be internally assigned to __cplusplus.
