.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Ft struct zip_source *
.Fn zip_source_zip "struct zip *archive" "struct zip *srcarchive" \
"int srcidx" "int flags" "off_t start" "off_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn zip_source_zip
creates a zip source from a file in a zip archive.
The
.Ar srcarchive
argument is the (open) zip archive containing the source zip file
at index
.Ar srcidx .
.Ar len
bytes from offset
.Ar start
will be used in the zip_source.
If
.Ar len
is 0 or \-1, the rest of the file, starting from
.Ar start ,
is used.
If
.Ar start
is zero and
.Ar len
is \-1, the whole file will be copied without decompressing it.
.Pp
Supported flags are:
.Bl -tag -width XZIPXFLXRECOMPRESSXXX
.It Dv ZIP_FL_UNCHANGED
Try to get the original data without any changes that may have been
made to
.Ar srcarchive
after opening it.
.It Dv ZIP_FL_RECOMPRESS
When adding the data from
.Ar srcarchive ,
re-compress it using the current settings instead of copying the
compressed data.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
