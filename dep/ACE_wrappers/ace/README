ACE Portability Macros
----------------------

The following describes the meaning of the C++ compiler macros that
can be set in the config*.h file.  When you port ACE to a new platform
and/or C++ compiler, make sure that you check to see which of these
need to be defined.  It's helpful to check the various config*.h files
in this directory to see what's already been defined.  If you need to
add new macros, please send them to me and I'll add them to this file.

Eventually, most of this information should be auto-discovered via GNU
autoconf, which is currently available in the ACE distribution.

Macro                                   Description
-----                                   -----------

ACE_HAS_DUMP                            Used to enable the dump()
                                        method bodies.  If not
                                        defined, the bodies are ifdef
                                        out in order to reduce
                                        footprint.  By default, it is
                                        not defined.
ACE_CAST_CONST                          Used to work around broken
                                        SunCC ANSI casts that require
                                        an extra const.
ACE_DEFINES_DEFAULT_WIN32_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES
                                        Win32 only.  Users want to use
                                        a predefined security
                                        attributes defined in
                                        ACE_OS::default_win32_security_attributes
                                        as the default security
                                        object.
ACE_DISABLE_DEBUG_DLL_CHECK             Define this if you don't want
                                        debug version ACE search for
                                        debug version DLLs first
                                        before looking for the DLL
                                        names specified.
ACE_DOESNT_INSTANTIATE_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER
                                        Application will allocate its
                                        own object manager.  This
                                        implicitly defines
                                        ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER.
                                        Usually used with MFC
                                        applications.
ACE_GETNAME_RETURNS_RANDOM_SIN_ZERO     Platform does not initialize
                                        sockaddr_in::sin_zero field in
                                        calls to getpeername() and
                                        getsockname().  As a result,
                                        memcmp()-based equality
                                        comparison can fail despite
                                        the fact two sockaddr_in
                                        instances refer to the same
                                        addr characteristics.
ACE_MAIN                                Renames "main (int, char *[])",
                                        for platforms such as g++/VxWorks
                                        that don't allow "main".  Requires
                                        the use of
                                        ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER.
ACE_MKDIR_LACKS_MODE                    This platform has a mkdir function with
                                        a mode argument
ACE_MT_SAFE                             Compile using multi-thread libraries
ACE_NDEBUG                              Turns off debugging features
ACE_NEW_THROWS_EXCEPTIONS               Compiler's 'new' throws exception on
                                        failure (ANSI C++ behavior).
ACE_NLOGGING                            Turns off the LM_DEBUG and
                                        LM_ERROR logging macros...
ACE_NTRACE                              Turns off the tracing feature when = 1.
ACE_HAS_TRACE                           Defined when ACE_NTRACE=0 to
                                        help support tracing.  Can
                                        also be defined by users who
                                        implement their own tracing
                                        macros based on
                                        ACE_TRACE_IMPL.  Not defining
                                        it helps reduce footprint by
                                        not requiring applications to
                                        link in Trace.o.
ACE_PAGE_SIZE                           Defines the page size of the
                                        system (not used on Win32 or
                                        with ACE_HAS_GETPAGESIZE).
ACE_REDEFINES_XTI_FUNCTIONS             Platform redefines the t_... names (UnixWare)
ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_PRAGMA            Compiler's template mechanism
                                        must use a pragma This is used
                                        for AIX's C++ compiler.
ACE_TEMPLATES_REQUIRE_SOURCE            Compiler's template mechanim
                                        must see source code (i.e.,
                                        .cpp files).  This is used for
                                        GNU G++.
ACE_TIMEPROBE_ASSERTS_FIXED_SIZE        If enabled then ACE_Timeprobe_Ex<>::timeprobe()
                                        will assert if the end of the
                                        buffer is reached.  If disabled, the
                                        counter wraps around to start
                                        at the beginning of the buffer.
ACE_TIMER_SKEW                          If a timed ::select () can return
                                        early, then ACE_TIMER_SKEW is the
                                        maximum adjustment, in microseconds,
                                        that ACE_Timer_Queue uses to
                                        compensate for the early return.
ACE_TLI_TCP_DEVICE                      Device the platform uses for TCP on
                                        TLI.  Only needed if not /dev/tcp.
ACE_USE_POLL                            The OS platform supports the
                                        poll() event demultiplexor
ACE_USES_ASM_SYMBOL_IN_DLSYM            Platform uses assembly symbols
                                        instead of C symbols in
                                        dlsym()
ACE_USES_STATIC_MFC                     When linking MFC as a static library is desired
ACE_USES_STD_NAMESPACE_FOR_STDCPP_LIB   Platform has its standard c++
                                        library in the namespace std.
ACE_USES_EXPLICIT_STD_NAMESPACE         Set this when ::fclose doesn't
                                        work and you have to
                                        explicitly specify the std
                                        namespace.   This is needed
                                        with the Borland 6 and earlier
                                        compilers.
ACE_USES_GPROF                          ACE calls getitimer before spawning
                                        a new thread and setitimer
                                        after spawning the thread in
                                        order to overcome the problems
                                        of gprof with multithreaded
                                        applications. It uses the idea from
                                        http://sam.zoy.org/writings/programming/gprof.html
ACE_USES_FIFO_SEM                       Directs ACE to use FIFO based semaphores on
                                        platforms that support this (not having full
                                        POSIX semaphore support, supporting mkfifo, select
                                        and fcntl).
ACE_WSOCK_VERSION                       A parameter list indicating
                                        the version of WinSock (e.g.,
                                        "1, 1" is version 1.1).
ACE_HAS_AIO_CALLS                       Platform supports POSIX aio* calls.
                                        Corresponds to _POSIX_ASYNCHRONOUS_IO
                                        constant in <unistd.h>.
ACE_HAS_ALT_CUSERID                     Use ACE's alternate cuserid()
                                        implementation since a system
                                        cuserid() may not exist, or it
                                        is not desirable to use it.
                                        The implementation requires
                                        ACE_LACKS_PWD_FUNCTIONS to be
                                        undefined and that the
                                        geteuid() system call exists.
ACE_HAS_DINKUM_STL                      Using the Dinkum STL library
ACE_HAS_HEADER_ALLOCATED_CLASS_STATIC_CONST_INT_STOREAGE
                                        Non-C++ Complient compilers that automatically
                                        provide storeage for class static const int
                                        when their declaration is seen. I.e. they object
                                        to explicit definitions being seen in the .cpp
                                        file.
ACE_DEFAULT_THREAD_KEYS                 Number of TSS keys, with
                                        ACE_HAS_TSS_EMULATION _only_.
                                        Defaults to 64.
ACE_DEFAULT_THREAD_STACKSIZE            Default stack size specified for the
                                        ACE thread spawning methods. Defaults
                                        to 0, which defers to OS defaults.
ACE_DEFAULT_LD_SEARCH_PATH              Specify the platform default search
                                        paths.  This macro should only be
                                        defined on platforms that don't
                                        support environment variables at all
                                        (i.e., Windows CE.)
ACE_THREADS_DONT_INHERIT_LOG_MSG        Specify this if you don't want
                                        threads to inherit parent
                                        thread's ACE_Log_Msg
                                        properties.
ACE_THREAD_MANAGER_USES_SAFE_SPAWN      Disable the "check before lock" feature
                                        in ACE_Thread_Manager.  Defining this
                                        macro avoids a potential race condition
                                        on platforms with aggressive read/write
                                        reordering.
ACE_HAS_CPU_SET_T                       Platform delivers cpu_set_t.
ACE_HAS_PRIOCNTL                        OS has priocntl (2).
ACE_HAS_RECURSIVE_MUTEXES               Mutexes are inherently recursive
                                        (e.g., Win32)
ACE_HAS_NONRECURSIVE_MUTEXES            In addition to recursive mutexes,
                                        platform has non-recursive ones also.
ACE_HAS_RECV_TIMEDWAIT                  Platform has the MIT pthreads
                                        APIs for
ACE_HAS_RECVFROM_TIMEDWAIT              timed send/recv operations
ACE_HAS_RECVMSG_TIMEDWAIT
ACE_HAS_RLIMIT_RESOURCE_ENUM            Platform has enum instead of
                                        int for first argument to
                                        ::{get,set}rlimit ().  The
                                        value of this macro is the
                                        enum definition, e.g., enum
                                        __rlimit_resource, for Linux
                                        glibc 2.0.
ACE_HAS_RUSAGE_WHO_ENUM                 Platform has enum instead of
                                        int for first argument to
                                        ::getrusage ().  The value of
                                        this macro is the enum
                                        definition, e.g., enum
                                        __rusage_who, for Linux glibc
                                        2.0.
ACE_HAS_SCANDIR                         Platform has a native scandir()
                                        function. Without any other scandir-
                                        related settings, it's assumed that
                                        the selector and comparator functions
                                        accept const ACE_DIRENT pointers.

                                        to wrap #include of
                                        sys/socket.h with
                                        #undef/#define of

                                        template destructor correctly. See
                                        "ace/OS.h" for details.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_ACCEPT_ADDR              Platform can't correctly deal
                                        with a NULL addr to accept()
                                        (e.g, VxWorks).

ACE_HAS_BROKEN_DGRAM_SENDV              Platform sendv() does not work
                                        properly with datagrams,
                                        i.e. it fails when the iovec
                                        size is IOV_MAX.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_MAP_FAILED               Platform doesn't cast MAP_FAILED

                                        inconsistent with libC
                                        definition of rand_r().
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_T_ERROR                  Compiler/platform has the wrong
                                        prototype for t_error(), i.e.,
                                        t_error(char *) rather than
                                        t_error(const char *).
ACE_HAS_BSTRING                         Platform has <bstring.h>
                                        (which contains bzero()
                                        prototype)

                                        dlopen/dlsym args, rather than
                                        const char *.
ACE_HAS_CHARPTR_SOCKOPT                 OS/platform uses char * for
                                        sockopt, rather than const
                                        char *

                                        TCP-related macros that netinet/tcp.h
                                        also defines, but they conflict
                                        (only seen on HP-UX 11).
ACE_HAS_CONSISTENT_SIGNAL_PROTOTYPES    Prototypes for both signal()
                                        and struct sigaction are
                                        consistent.

ACE_HAS_BROKEN_UNEXPECTED_EXCEPTIONS    Compiler does not call
                                        unexpected exception handler
                                        if exception not listed in
                                        exception specification is
                                        thrown.  In particular, the
                                        exception specification is not
                                        respected.
ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION_EXPORT  When a base-class is a
                                        specialization of a class template
                                        then this class template must be
                                        explicitly exported
ACE_HAS_EXPLICIT_STATIC_TEMPLATE_MEMBER_INSTANTIATION  For the GCC compiler
                                        on AIX, HPUX and VxWorks we have to
                                        explicitly instantiate static template
                                        members else we get multiple instances
                                        of the same static.

                                        ACE_PAGE_SIZE must be defined,
                                        except on Win32)
ACE_HAS_GETRUSAGE                       Platform supports the

                                        that differs from the one in
                                        ace/OS.i.
ACE_HAS_GNU_CSTRING_H                   Denotes that GNU has cstring.h
                                        as standard which redefines

ACE_HAS_GETIFADDRS                      This platform has ifaddrs.h and
                                        the getifaddrs() function.  This
                                        is used in preference to
                                        the SIOCGIFCONF ioctl call, since
                                        it is much simpler and supports
                                        IPv6 and non-IP interfaces better.
ACE_HAS_HANDLE_SET_OPTIMIZED_FOR_SELECT Optimize

ACE_HAS_IP_MULTICAST                    Platform supports IP multicast
ACE_HAS_IPV6                            Platform supports IPv6.
ACE_HAS_BROKEN_GETHOSTBYADDR_V4MAPPED   gethostbyaddr does not handle
                                        IPv6-mapped-IPv4 addresses
ACE_USES_IPV4_IPV6_MIGRATION            Enable IPv6 support in ACE on
                                        platforms that don't have IPv6
                                        turned on by default.
ACE_HAS_IPV6_V6ONLY                     Platform supports the IPPROTO_IPV6
                                        level IPV6_V6ONLY socket option.
ACE_HAS_IRIX62_THREADS                  Platform supports the very odd
                                        IRIX 6.2 threads...
ACE_HAS_NONSTATIC_OBJECT_MANAGER        Causes the ACE_Object_Manager
                                        instance to be created in main
                                        (int, char *[]), instead of as
                                        a static (global) instance.
ACE_HAS_THR_KEYDELETE                   Platform supports
                                        thr_keydelete (e.g,. UNIXWARE)
ACE_HAS_THR_MINSTACK                    Platform calls thr_minstack()
                                        rather than thr_min_stack()
                                        (e.g., Tandem).
ACE_HAS_LIMITED_RUSAGE_T                The rusage_t structure has
                                        only two fields.
ACE_HAS_LIMITED_SELECT                  The select is unable to deal with
                                        large file descriptors.

                                        with GLibc including new NPTL (Native
                                        POSIX Thread Library).
                                        This triggers extended POSIX checks

                                        a private, unimplemented copy
                                        constructor or assignment
                                        operator.  The SGI C++
                                        compiler needs this, in
                                        template classes, with
                                        ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_INSTANTIATION_PRAGMA.
ACE_NEEDS_HUGE_THREAD_STACKSIZE         Required by platforms with
                                        small default stacks.
ACE_NEEDS_LWP_PRIO_SET                  OS has LWPs, and when the
                                        priority of a bound thread is
                                        set, then the LWP priority
                                        must be set also.
ACE_NEEDS_SCHED_H                       Platform needs to #include
                                        <sched.h>
                                        to get thread scheduling
                                        defs.

ACE_NO_WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN              If this is set, then ACE does not
                                        define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN before
                                        including <windows.h>. Needed for
                                        code that uses non-lean Win32
                                        facilities such as COM.

ACE_ONLY_LATEST_AND_GREATEST            A macro that indicates that
                                        the "latest and greatest"
                                        features of ACE/TAO should be
                                        turned on.  It has been
                                        replaced by ACE_LEGACY_MODE,
                                        which has the opposite meaning
                                        but serves the same purpose.

ACE_SHM_OPEN_REQUIRES_ONE_SLASH         The path specified on shm_open() must
                                        have a leading, single slash and not
                                        have any other slashes.

ACE_WSTRING_HAS_USHORT_SUPPORT          If a platform has wchar_t as a
                                        separate type, then
                                        ACE_WString doesn't have a
                                        constructor that understands
                                        an ACE_USHORT16 string.  So
                                        this macro enables
                                        one. (mostly used my ACE Name
                                        Space).

ACE_HAS_BROKEN_PREALLOCATED_OBJECTS_AFTER_FORK
                                        Under QNX/RTP the objects preallocated
                                        in ACE_OS_Object_Manager cannot be
                                        destroyed after a fork() call.
                                        Since these objects are only destroyed
                                        at application shutdown we take the
                                        simpler approach of not destroying
                                        them at all.
                                        Both QNX/RTP and LynxOS suffer from
                                        this problem.

ACE_LACKS_MEMBER_TEMPLATES              Compiler does not support
                                        member template feature.

ACE_LACKS_DEPRECATED_MACROS             When this define is set, macros which
                                        are deprecated are not defined. Usefull
                                        to check whether deprecated macros are
                                        not used anymore.

ACE_DONT_INIT_WINSOCK                   This definition defines whether or not
                                        to explicitly initialize Winsock during
                                        ACE::init() (i.e., whether WSAStartup()
                                        is called). Some Win32 platforms have
                                        dependent characteristics between
                                        ACE initialization and
                                        network initialization.

----------------------------------------

The following macros determine the svc.conf file format ACE uses.

Macro                                   Description
-----                                   -----------
ACE_HAS_CLASSIC_SVC_CONF                This macro forces ACE to use
                                        the classic svc.conf format.

ACE_HAS_XML_SVC_CONF                    This macro forces ACE to use the XML
                                        svc.conf format.

ACE_USES_CLASSIC_SVC_CONF               This macro should be defined
                                        as 0 or 1, depending on the
                                        preferred svc.conf file
                                        format.  Defining this macro
                                        to 0 means ACE will use XML
                                        svc.conf file format.
                                        Defining it to 1 will force
                                        ACE to use the classic
                                        svc.conf format.
                                        ** This macro takes precedence
                                        ** over previous two macros.

----------------------------------------
The following is a partial list of where some of these macros are used
in the code.  This list was originally compiled by Jam Hamidi
(jh1@core01.osi.com).  It is now hopelessly out of date.  Hopefully,
someone will come along and update it....

ACE_HAS_ALLOCA:
---------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/SOCK_Connect.C
        for allocation of iovp
A
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE_Msg.C
        for alocation of iovp

  In solaris:
     alloca() allocates size bytes of space in the stack frame of
     the  caller,  and  returns a pointer to the allocated block.
     This temporary space is automatically freed when the  caller
     returns.  Note: if the allocated block is beyond the current
     stack limit, the resulting behavior is undefined.

  In HPUX:
     no equivalent.

  Notes:
     in HPUX it has to do new and delete. Affects performance.


ACE_HAS_AUTOMATIC_INIT_FINI:
----------------------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/Service_Configurator/Service_Repository.i
     libsrc/Service_Configurator/Parse_Node.i
     include/Parse_Node.i
     include/Service_Repository.i

  In solaris:
     _init() initializes a loadable module. It is  called  before
     any other routine in a loadable module.
     _info()  returns  information  about  a   loadable   module.
     _fini() should return the return value from mod_remove(9F).
     This flag if set, doesn't do anything.  If not set, forces
     _init() and _fini() to be executed as is:
       dlsym ((char *) handle, "_fini").

  In HPUX:
     don't set.
     Maybe have to look into shl_load( ), shl_definesym( ),
     shl_findsym( ), shl_gethandle( ), shl_getsymbols( ),
     shl_unload( ), shl_get( )(3X) - explicit load of shared libraries
     Means Service Configurator won't be available.
     TBA.


ACE_HAS_CPLUSPLUS_HEADERS:
--------------------------

  Used In:
     ace/OS.h

  HPUX:
     set it.

  Notes:
     If this is not defined, libc.h and osfcn.h get included.
     Only needed for older compiler/OS platforms that don't
     provide standard C++ header files in /usr/include.

ACE_HAS_HI_RES_TIMER:
---------------------

  Used In:
     libsrc/Misc/High_Res_Timer.h
     libsrc/Misc/High_Res_Timer.C
     include/High_Res_Timer.h

  In Solaris,
     C++ wrapper around gethrtime(), which returns a long long.
         gethrtime() returns the current high-resolution  real  time.
     Time  is  expressed as nanoseconds since some arbitrary time
     in the past; it is not correlated in any way to the time  of
     day,  and  thus  is not subject to resetting, drifting, etc.

  In HPUX
     look into: getclock(), reltimer(), getitimer()
     maybe even vtimes structure vm_utime, vm_stime ?

  Notes:
     TBA


ACE_LACKS_T_ERRNO:
-------------------

  Used In:
     ace/OS.h

  HPUX:
     set it.

  Notes:
     if set, adds:
     extern int t_errno;


ACE_HAS_POSIX_NONBLOCK:
-----------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  HPUX:
     set it.

  Notes:
     if defined, sets ACE_NONBLOCK and O_NONBLOCK
     O_NONBLOCK is used in libsrc/Misc/misc.C to do a
       fcntl (fd, F_SETFL, opt)
     ACE_NONBLOCK is used in libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Recv.C in the
       disable member function and options passed to the open function
       in libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO.C


ACE_HAS_PROC_FS:
----------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h
     libsrc/Misc/Profile_Timer.i

  Notes:
     if set, includes <sys/procfs.h>
     the PIOCUSAGE define is used in Profile_Timer.

  Solaris:
     procfs.h defines things for the prpsinfo structure (basically to
     do a "ps" from inside a program).

  HPUX:
     don't set: obviously a different mechanism.
     Look into /usr/include/sys/proc.h.  The structure is proc.  The
     pointer to the kernel's proc table may be obtained by
     extern  struct  proc *proc, *procNPROC;
     extern  int nproc;


ACE_HAS_PRUSAGE_T:
------------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/Misc/Profile_Timer.h
     libsrc/Misc/Profile_Timer.C

  Notes:
     If defined, declares the Profile_Timer class that does start(),
     stop() and basically gets real_time, user_time, system_time for
     an interval.
     This stuff is highly non-portable.

  HPUX:
     don't set


ACE_HAS_SEMUN:
--------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/Semaphores/Semaphore_Simple.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, defines semun as:
     union semun {
           int          val;    /* value for SETVAL */
           struct semid_ds      *buf;   /* buffer for IPC_STAT & IPC_SET */
           ushort               *array; /* array for GETALL & SETALL */
     };

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     in /usr/include/sem.h:
     /* The fourth argument to semctl() varies depending on the value of
       its first argument.  If desired, "union semun" can be declared
       by the user, but this is not necessary since the individual
       member can just be passed as the argument. */


ACE_HAS_SIG_ATOMIC_T:
---------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, does a:
     typedef int sig_atomic_t;
     This is used in the Reactor and service configurator.

  HPUX:
     set it.
     in /usr/include/sys/signal.h:
     typedef unsigned int sig_atomic_t;


ACE_HAS_SSIZE_T:
----------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, does a
     typedef int ssize_t;
     used mostly in IPC_SAP.  (don't confuse with size_t).

  HPUX:
     set it.
     in /usr/include/sys/types.h


ACE_HAS_STRBUF_T:
-----------------

  Used in:
     include/Str_Buf.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, declares the strbuf structure as:
     struct strbuf
     {
       int      maxlen;                 /* no. of bytes in buffer */
       int      len;                    /* no. of bytes returned */
       void     *buf;                   /* pointer to data */
     };

  Solaris:
     defined in /usr/include/sys/stropts.h
     Sys V.4 Streams.
     uses strbuf as parameter to putmsg, putpmsg:
     int putmsg(int fildes, const struct strbuf *ctlptr,
          const struct strbuf *dataptr, int flags);

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     no SYS V.4 streams.


ACE_HAS_STREAMS:
----------------

  Used In:
     ace/OS.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SOCK_SAP/LSOCK.C

  Notes:
     if defined, includes <stropts.h>

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     no SYS V.4 streams.


ACE_HAS_STREAM_PIPES:
---------------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE_Msg.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE_Msg.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE_Listener.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE_Listener.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/SPIPE_SAP/SPIPE.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Send_Msg.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Send_Msg.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Send_Msg.i
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Recv_Msg.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Recv_Msg.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/FIFO_SAP/FIFO_Recv_Msg.i

  Notes:
     if not set, won't be able to use the SPIPE class (IPC_SAP) with
     rendezvous handles.

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     No sysV.4 streams.


ACE_HAS_STRERROR:
-----------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, does a:
     #define strerror(err) sys_errlist[err]

  Solaris:
     /usr/include/string.h

  HPUX:
     set it.
     in /usr/include/sys/errno.h and string.h
     extern char *strerror (int);


ACE_HAS_SVR4_DYNAMIC_LINKING:
-----------------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h
     tests/Service_Configurator/CCM_App.C

  Notes:
     if defined, includes <dlfcn.h>
     with dlopen(), dlsym(), etc..

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     has its own:
     shl_findsym( ), shl_gethandle( ), shl_getsymbols( ),
     shl_unload( ), shl_get( )(3X) - explicit load of shared libraries


ACE_HAS_SVR4_GETTIMEOFDAY:
--------------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h
     libsrc/Reactor/Timer_Queue.i

  Notes:
     has to do with gettimeofday ().

  Solaris:
     gettimeofday (struct timeval *tp)

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     it has gettimeofday (struct timeval *tp, struct timezone *tzp);
     most calls do a:
     #if defined (ACE_HAS_SVR4_GETTIMEOFDAY)
      ::gettimeofday (&cur_time);
     #else
      ::gettimeofday (&cur_time, 0);
     #endif /* ACE_HAS_SVR4_GETTIMEOFDAY */


ACE_HAS_POLL:
------------
  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     #if defined (ACE_HAS_POLL)
     #include /**/ <poll.h>
     #endif /* ACE_HAS_POLL */

ACE_USE_POLL_IMPLEMENTATION:
------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
    Use the poll() event demultiplexor rather than select().

  HPUX:
     set it.


ACE_HAS_SVR4_SIGNAL_T:
----------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     #if defined (ACE_HAS_SVR4_SIGNAL_T)
     typedef void (*SignalHandler)(int);
     typedef void (*SignalHandlerV)(void);
     #elif defined (ACE_HAS_SIGNALHANDLERV_INT_ARG)
     typedef void (*SignalHandler)(int);
     typedef void (*SignalHandlerV)(int);
     #else
     #define SignalHandler SIG_PF
     typedef void (*SignalHandlerV)(...);
     #endif /* ACE_HAS_SVR4_SIGNAL_T */

  HPUX:
     set it.


ACE_HAS_SVR4_TLI:
-----------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/TLI_SAP/TLI.C
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/TLI_SAP/TLI.h
     libsrc/IPC_SAP/TLI_SAP/TLI_Stream.C

  Notes:
     TLI is the transport layer calls as in: t_bind(), t_open(), t_unbind(),
     t_optmgmt(), ... in SunOS and Solaris.

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     Not supported.


ACE_HAS_SYS_FILIO_H:
--------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if not defined, includes <sys/filio.h>.
     didn't find any reference to anything in this file in the ACE code.

  Solaris:
     filio.h defines FIOCLEX, FIOASYNC, ... as _IO('f', 1), ..
     for FIOLFS,.. solaris has this to say:
     /*
      * ioctl's for Online: DiskSuite.
      * WARNING - the support for these ioctls may be withdrawn
      * in the future OS releases.
      */

  HPUX:
     <sys/ioctl.h> defines FIOASYNC and some other ones,
     <sgtty.h> defines some like FIOCLEX.
     some are never defined.
     use #ifdef HP-UX to modify sysincludes.h


ACE_HAS_SYS_SIGLIST:
--------------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h
     libsrc/Log_Msg/Log_Msg.C

  Notes:
     if not defined, does a:
     extern const char **_sys_siglist;

  Solaris:
     This is an array holding signal descriptions.

  HPUX:
     don't set.
     Some additional work is required.  In libsrc/Log_Msg/Log_Msg.C,
     sys_siglist is used regardless of ACE_HAS_SYS_SIGLIST.
     have to add #ifdefs to remove them.


ACE_HAS_TEMPLATE_TYPEDEFS:
--------------------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/ASX/*.[Chi]

  Notes:
     cfront-based C++ compilers don't implement templates that support
     classes with typedefs of other types as formal arguments.  This
     typedef uses the C++ preprocessor to work around this problem.

ACE_HAS_THREADS:
----------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/Service_Configurator/Svc_Conf.y.C
     libsrc/Service_Configurator/Thread_Spawn.i
     libsrc/Threads/Synch.C
     libsrc/Threads/Synch.i
     libsrc/Threads/Thr_Manager.i
     libsrc/ASX/STREAM.C
     libsrc/ASX/Queue.C
     libsrc/ASX/Module.C
     libsrc/ASX/Stream_Modules.C
     libsrc/ASX/Multiplexor.C
     libsrc/ASX/Message_List.C
     include/Message_List.h
     include/Module.h
     include/Multiplexor.h
     include/Queue.h
     include/STREAM.h
     include/Stream_Modules.h
     include/Service_Types.h
     include/Thread_Spawn.h
     include/Synch.h
     include/Thr_Manager.h

  Notes:
     We use Message_List.h even in a non-threaded environment.
     our XOMessageList.h does this by #ifdefs around Threaded things.

  HPUX:
     not until 10.0.


ACE_HAS_TIMOD_H:
----------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if defined, include <sys/timod.h>

  Solaris:
     timod is a STREAMS module for use with the Transport  Inter-
     face  (TI)  functions  of the Network Services library.  The
     timod module converts a set of ioctl(2) calls  into  STREAMS
     messages  that  may be consumed by a transport protocol pro-
     vider that supports the Transport Interface.  This allows  a
     user to initiate certain TI functions as atomic operations.

  HPUX:
     don't set.


ACE_HAS_TIUSER_H:
-----------------

  Used in:
     ace/OS.h

  Notes:
     if set, includes <tiuser.h>

  Solaris:
     in conjunction with t_bind, t_accept, etc.. transport layer.

  HPUX:
     don't set.


ACE_USE_POLL_IMPLEMENTATION:
----------------------------

  Used in:
     libsrc/Reactor/Reactor.i
     include/Event_Handler.h
     ace/OS.h
     include/Reactor.h

  Notes:
     in the reactor, use poll instead of select.  In general,
     good thing to have set.

ACE_USES_GPROF:
----------------------------
  Used in:
    ace/Base_Thread_Adapter.h
    ace/Base_Thread_Adapter.inl
    ace/Base_Thread_Adapter.cpp

  Notes:
    When using gprof mainly on Linux, #define ACE_USES_GPROF
    will add calls to getitimer/setitimer in order to initialize profile
    timer and overcome the problem of gprof with multithreaded applications.

ACE_QTREACTOR_CLEAR_PENDING_EVENTS:
----------------------------
  Used in:
    ace/QtReactor.cpp:
    QtReactor by default does not clear qt events pending for
    activated socket. Clearing costs much, at least 2 hash accesses
    in ACE, and 2 another in Qt. It is also better to not clear
    pending events as some side effects are unknown. However,
    when events are not clear, then some user applications may be
    confused by handle_input/output/exception called without any
    data eg. in ACE_Acceptor::make_svc_handler. This swithc is
    intended to quickly fix user application which does not
    follow some reactor rules.
 Linux:
   It seems linux::qt does not queue pending events. Do not define
   this switch.
 Windows:
   Windows::qt queues pending events. If user application has handle_*
   methods which cannot be called without data, then turn on this switch
   to quickly fix the bug. However, one should seriously fix the
   application then.
