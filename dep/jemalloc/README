jemalloc is a general-purpose scalable concurrent malloc(3) implementation.
This distribution is a "portable" implementation that currently targets
FreeBSD, Linux, Apple OS X, and MinGW.  jemalloc is included as the default
allocator in the FreeBSD and NetBSD operating systems, and it is used by the
Mozilla Firefox web browser on Microsoft Windows-related platforms.  Depending
on your needs, one of the other divergent versions may suit your needs better
than this distribution.
