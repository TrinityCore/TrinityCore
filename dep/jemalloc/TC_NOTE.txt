*** THIS FILE CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT CHANGES DONE TO THE JEMALLOC LIBRARY FILES ***
Removed from archive, as OSX does not use jemalloc:
  src/zone.c
  include/jemalloc/internal/zone.h

Filename changed, as it messes up Windows-systems (when will Microsoft learn?) :
  include/jemalloc/internal/prn.h -> include/jemalloc/internal/jemprn.h

References to prn.h has been changed to use the new filename where needed.
