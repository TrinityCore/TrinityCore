(2296, 'The Earthmother\'s eyes shone down upon the lands she had breathed into creation. Her right eye, An\'she (the sun), gave warmth and light to the land. Her left eye, Mu\'sha (the moon), gave peace and sleep to the stirring creatures of the dawning. Such was the power of her gaze that the Earthmother closed one dreaming eye for every turning of the sky. Thus, her loving gaze turned day into night for the first dawning of the world.   $B', 2297),
(2297, 'While the right eye shone down upon the golden dawn, the Earthmother\'s gentle hands spread out across the golden plains. Wherever the shadow of her arms passed, a noble people arose from the rich soil. The Shu\'halo (the tauren) arose to give thanks and prayer to their loving mother. There, in the endless fields of dawn, the children of the earth swore themselves to her grace and vowed to bless her name until the final darkening of the world.', 0),

(2303, 'Seeking to escape, the great stag leapt into the sky. Yet, as his escape seemed assured, his mighty antlers tangled in the stars which held him fast. Though he kicked and struggled, Apa\'ro could not loose himself from the heavens. It was then that Mu\'sha found him as she chased her brother, An\'she, towards the dawn. Mu\'sha saw the mighty stag as he struggled and fell in love with him immediately. ', 2304),
(2308, 'As the mists of dawn faded and the Age of Memory advanced, the demigod, Cenarius, went his own way through the fields of the world. The Shu\'halo (tauren) were sorrowful at his passing and forgot much of the druidism he had taught them. As the generations passed, they forgot how to speak with the trees and the wild things of the land. The dark whispers from the deeps of the world drifted up to their ears once again.', 2309),

Out of the black lands of the west came a horde of murderous creatures - the centaur. Cannibals and ravagers, the centaur fell upon the Shu\'halo like a plague. Though the braves and hunters fought with the Earthmother\'s blessing in their hearts, the centaur could not be defeated.', 2310),
