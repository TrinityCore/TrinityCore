When I am not getting food or protecting myself from the periodic rain, all my thoughts are of rescue.$B$BI would not be so hopeful if it were not for the boxes of paper and bottles that washed ashore with me.  I laugh now to think of all the time I spent on that ship cursing that I was stuck with a boatload of Alchemists and Scribes." WHERE `ID`=696;
UPDATE `page_text` SET `Text`="Diary - Day 512$B$BThe bananas have started talking to me and I have learned a great deal about their culture.  I have ceased my senseless destruction of their homes and consumption of the young.  How little I knew then of the great civilization that I was destroying.$B$BOn another topic I seem to be running low on bottles and paper.  When I first looked at those huge stacks of paper that washed ashore I thought they would be inexhaustible.  Woe with me, my diary must end soon." WHERE `ID`=697;
