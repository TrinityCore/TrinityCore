It would probably be less boring outside.  It's decided - I am now responsible for watching the hall AND the outside.  I shall take on my new responsibility next month.$B                -ARCHAVON$B$BDay 20120:$BThe outside is much more open than the hall.  There are convenient cliffs and mountains bordering it.  I'm now confident that the Makers meant for me to watch this too.  I hope they don't notice that I've only been in the hall for the first decade.$B                -ARCHAVON$B" WHERE `ID`=3548;
