Some of his dearest friends have sided with our enemy. We need new allies more than ever.$B Your heroism is an inspiration to us.  I have sent Beska Redtusk to Warspear Hold in Ashran - speak with her if you need any supplies from our clan\'s stockpile. It is the least we can offer.$B - Draka of the Frostwolves', 0);
