The flight from Blackrock Spire was chaotic, to say the least. Unfortunately along the way, Mor somehow lost his footing, though I suspect that he was pushed. In any case, he fell down in to the recesses of the lower portion of the spire.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>' WHERE `entry`=2863;

Not long after, as he was being tortured by War Master Voone, a group of Valthalak''s assassins jumped in and finished the job.</P><BR/><P align=\"left\">Should you seek to raise the echo of Mor Grayhoof''s spirit, War Master Voone''s chamber is a haunted location.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>' WHERE `entry`=2864;

Yet their skills as combatants were exceptional, and they came from money, which I suppose is why Anthion, the leader of The Veiled Blade, kept them on.</P><BR/><P align=\"left\">The siblings eventually found themselves enamored with the teachings and philosophy of the Scarlet Crusade.

Of particular interest to them was a position of knighthood within the ranks; something that required more difficult testing apparently. For it was later discovered that Sothos actually failed his final test. Jarien would not have it though, and in open defiance she insisted that he be able to join her amongst the knights. From what we have gathered, Grand Crusader Dathrohan slew them both right on the spot in the middle of his chambers.</P><BR/><P align=\"left\">Thus it is that another of these haunted loci is The Crimson Throne inside The Scarlet Bastion at Stratholme.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>' WHERE `entry`=2866;

He proved himself invaluable in helping us to get out of a sticky situation we fell into there, however, and so he came on as one of the company''s premier mages.</P><BR/><P align=\"left\">The odd thing about him though was the completely different nature of his two heads.

Unfortunately the creepy head exhibited an affinity for raising dead spirits, and took a perverse pleasure in it, especially in summoning forth the exiled spirits of Purgation Isle to do his bidding.</P><BR/><P align=\"left\">After the company disbanded, Kormok enrolled at the Scholomance to further his ''education''. The spectral assassins found entrance to the school all too easy, and slew him right there in front of his new master, Ras Frostwhisper.</P><BR/><P align=\"left\">This makes Ras Frostwhisper''s chamber one of the haunted locations where the brazier can be successfully utilized.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>' WHERE `entry`=2868;

It is common for the leadership of the Spire to change hands, and unfortunately for us, we were going to play a part in the latest shift in power.</P><BR/><P align=\"left\">We''d been commissioned by a goblin smuggler-wizard out of Booty Bay, Gremnik Rizzlesprang, to steal Valthalak''s spellbook. We don''t know if he wanted to study it or sell it (or both), and it doesn''t matter now.

But take it we did, and it proved to be the last job we ever would take.</P><BR/><P align=\"left\">Having slain Lord Valthalak, and taken his spellbook, Kormok must have sensed something about his amulet. He insisted on taking it as his share of the loot, which quickly devolved into a heated argument, and almost a fight, over the thing.

But, even from the beyond, Valthalak sent his minions at us no matter where we hid. The Veiled Blade soon broke apart after that mission, and then we were really easy pickings.</P><BR/><P align=\"left\">As you must know, this makes Lord Valthalak''s abode, what is now The Beast''s chamber in Blackrock Spire, the last of the haunted locations.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>' WHERE `entry`=2871;
