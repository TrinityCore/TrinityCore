-- Usually we have more than one page archived in 2010 from diffrent months, but only one random is used as source(it's faster to allow
-- web.archive to take you to random page). Last (before data wipe) archived pages has bigger total count(how many times creature was
-- skinned) (almost always it gives more accurate chance and more items(important in cases like this one where creature was skinned only
-- few hundred times. With such total count sometimes it's hard enough to make 100% correct decision)). â€‹But this case is different in a
-- weird way. For some reason one of items simply dissapeared in May but was shown in April. Since I used the one from May, that made me
-- create completely different template only for one creature for no real reason. This is something to take in consideration in future
-- and use only last pages in cases with small total count
