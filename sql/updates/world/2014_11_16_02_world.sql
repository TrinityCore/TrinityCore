(4851, 'Magra, my huntress,\r\n\r\nAnother dull day at Stonefang outpost. As I stare across the flats, I cannot help but think of you. Do you remember the day we met? I hurled my axe at your mount, and you nearly impaled me with a spear.\r\n\r\nIt was love at first sight.\r\n\r\nClans be damned! My mind is made up. I will leave it all to be with you. Choose the place. I will come. We\'ll leave Frostfire and make a life somewhere. I hear Nagrand is beautiful.\r\n\r\nYour future mate,\r\n\r\nKarash\r\n\r\nP.S. I have enclosed Longhowl\'s first-fang. I was wearing it around my neck that day. I hope it will guide me to you once again.', 19116);
